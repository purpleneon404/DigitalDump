| |
|SinceSeptember 2014, I have been gathering recommendations of “philosophicallyinteresting” science fiction – or “speculative fiction” (SF), more broadlyconstrued – from professional philosophers. So far, 48 philosophers have contributed (plus one co-contributor).  Each contributor has recommended ten works ofspeculative fiction and has written a brief “pitch” gesturing toward theinterest of the work.|
| |
|Belowis the list of recommendations, arranged to highlight the authors and filmdirectors or TV shows who were most often recommended by the listcontributors.  I have divided the listinto (A.) novels, short stories, and other printed media, vs (B.) movies, TVshows, and other non-printed media. Within each category, works are listed by author or director/show, inorder of how many different contributors recommended that author or director,and then by chronological order of works for authors and directors/shows withmultiple listed works.  For worksrecommended more than once, I have included each contributor’s pitch on aseparate line.|

|Recommended by Thirteen|
|Ursula K. Le Guin|
|·        The Left Hand of Darkness (novel, 1969)|
|o   First contact story about someone encountering a society withradically different manifestations of gender roles, sexuality, and socialnorms. Examines issues of gender and sexuality, as well as love and friendship.(Powell)|
|o   Explores a society where its inhabitants do not have a gender. (DeCruz)|
|o   The meaning of gender is explored when a male protagonist comes to aplanet inhabited by humans who change their gender naturally. (Evnine)|
|·        “Nine Lives” (short story, 1969). What is it like to be a clone? And morespecifically, what is it like to have one’s connection to other clones severedafter having been raised together with them? (Kind) |
|·        “The Word for World is Forest” (shortstory, 1972, later expanded to a novel, 1976). A logging camp on another worlduses the native species as slave labor. Reflections on colonialism andresponsibility, as well as on social change. What is it to be a person? How do(and how should) societies change? (J. Kaplan) |
|·        “The Ones Who Walk Away fromOmelas”(shortstory, 1973)|
|o   The problem of evil; one aspect of it I particularly like is that itputs the problem in more human-sized terms, where the readers must askthemselves whether they would be the sort of person described by the title, ornot. (Weinberg)|
|o   A purported reductio of utilitarianism. (Blumson)|
|·        The Dispossessed (novel, 1974)|
|o   Surely the reasons for this are well known enough; amazingexploration of political and social possibilities. (Allais)|
|o   Follows a physicist from an “anarchist” society. Reflections onpolitical systems, morality, political organizing. Do all great dreams fail? Isit the nature of all political systems to decay into bureaucracies, or worse?(J. Kaplan)|
|o   A gripping story investigating a society that has embraced andinternalized a full-blown communalism. Examines issues of privacy and property,and the individual’s relationship to society. (Powell)|
|o   Anarcho-syndicalism vs capitalism; scarcity and abundance;co-operation and competition; sclerosis of a revolution. (Oppenheimer)|
|o   Another critique of contemporary social-political philosophy … sureto be relevant for some time to come. (Prescott)|
|·        “The Author of the AcaciaSeeds, and Other Extracts from the Journal of the Association of Therolinguistics” and “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” (short stories, 1982 and 1973). The first: always nice when sciencefiction remembers that linguistics is a science. The second: a powerfulcounterexample, but note only to certain forms of consequentialism. Think of itas an argument for good social choice theory. (Dever)|
|·        Always Coming Home (novel, 1985). A very nonstandard imagining of a potential humanfuture, set in Northern California, in which humans have returned to a largelyprimitive and peaceful state of existence, turning their backs on consumerismand, for the most part, technology. A lovely act of anthropologicalimagination. (Jollimore)|
|·        Changing Planes (short stories, collected 2003). Airports are not just places fortransportation between spatial locations; they also host people who want tochange dimensions in between changing flights. Traveler stops over in severalother exotic dimensions, including one in which everything unnecessary forhuman life has been removed (“The Nna Mmoy Language”). Possible worlds with foreign-yet-familiarfeatures. (Bernstein)|
| |
|Recommended by Eleven|
|Ted Chiang|
|·        Stories of Your Life andOthers (short stories, collected 2002, containing all of the pre-2003 selectedstories below)|
|o   Many others have recommended Chiang and this is absolutely, utterlyjustified. His stories are far more sophisticated than those of most other sfauthors. He is a ‘new’ author, relatively. But he is up there with the best ofthe classic authors, deservedly. I teach eight Chiang stories every semesterand, at most, two by any other author. (Holbo)|
|o   Short stories following through on the consequences of variousideas. What if arithmetic actually was inconsistent? What if we did live in asystem of celestial spheres? (Yap)|
|o   A collection of scifi short storiesexploring diverse philosophical themes -- the problem of evil, the relationshipbetween language and time, the ethics of beauty. Most of the stories offer anoriginal and highly creative take on the issue at hand. (Sullivan)|
|o  One story features aliens whose language is visual and non-linear instead oflinear and temporal; another features people who disable the part of theirbrain that makes beauty judgments about other people. (Schwitzgebel)|
|·        “Division ByZero” (short story, 1991). One of the few works I’ve seen of mathematicalscience fiction (rather than empirical science fiction), impressive treatmentof the possibility that arithmetic is inconsistent. (Powell)|
|·        “Understand” (short story, 1991)|
|o  Thorough and convincingfirst-person phenomenology of human super intelligence--you’ll feel like youknow what it’s like to get your IQ quadrupled overnight. (Mandik)|
|o  Coupled with “Flowers forAlgernon,” another exploration of intelligence, its limits, and its potential.(Bein)|
|·        “Hell is the Absence of God” (short story, 2001). Story set in a world where everyone hasconcrete evidence of the existence of God and an afterlife, but no betterunderstanding of why there is suffering. Examines issues in philosophy ofreligion, epistemology, the problem of evil and divine hiddenness. (Powell)|
|·        “Story of Your Life” /“Evolution of Human Science” (short stories, 1998/2000).These stories are very different, but both raise fascinating questions aboutthe nature of science, the role of humans in science, and the consequences ofdealing with scientific progress that exceeds the understanding of individualhumans. (Powell)|
|·        “Hell Is the Absence of God,” “Seventy-Two Letters,” and “Story ofYour Life” (short stories, 1998-2001).  Each of these is a fully envisioned realitythat offers a new way of seeing our own. They are each mind-blowing in adistinctive, inventive way. Ted Chiang is a genius. (Daly)|
|·        “Liking What You See: ADocumentary” (short story, 2002)|
|o   In the same vein as Vonnegut’s 1961 “Harrison Bergeron,” here Chiangoffers us a brilliant semi-story in which a campus community takes seriously apervasive but undiscussed bias – lookism. (Nichols)|
|o   “Lookism” is the idea that how somebody looks – that is, howattractive they are judged to be by society – has an undue influence on theadvantages and disadvantages a person experiences. If we were able to disablethe part of the brain that judges the attractiveness of faces – if we were ableto reversibly induce the brain disorder known as prosopagnosia – should we?This short story explores that possibility. (Keeley)|
|o   A meditation on beauty, ugliness, and whether it is possible forthem to be invisible. (Bein)|
|·        TheLifecycle of Software Objects (novel,2010).  Could an AI have moral rights,even if it’s just software? It is hard to imagine drumming up sympathy for thecharacters in your computer games, but this novel succeeds in pushing us toconsider even bodyless software blips as objects ofmoral concern. (Daly)|
|·        “The Truth of Fact, TheTruth of Feeling” (short story, 2013). One of Chiang's most philosophical stories,which is saying a lot. Examines the unreliability of memory. If I had more roomfor a longer list, at least half of Chiang's stories would be on it. (Baker)|
|Philip K. Dick|
|·        “The Defenders” (short story, 1953). It forms a great counterpoint to “Autofac.” In “Autofac,” themachines mindlessly consume the planet to create consumer goods. In “TheDefenders,” – spoiler alert – the machines realize that the humans’ mindlessdestruction of the planet (through war, this time, rather than production) isirrational, and instead they just fake massive destruction to placate thehumans. (Wittkower) |
|·        “Autofac” (short story, 1955). A short story about the grey goo problem innanotech, which is, um, a pretty interesting thing to find someone writingabout in the ‘50s. Relevant to the difficulty of acting responsibly with regardto complex systems whose effects are hard to predict, and about thequestionable value of autonomy when you don’t have any particular rationaldetermination of values that would guide what you would do with that autonomy.(Wittkower)|
|·        Time out of Joint (novel, 1959). Not his best, nor yet his most disturbed, fantasy,but a neat demonstration of what it would be like to discover that one’s entirelife and surroundings are fake! (Clark)|
|·        “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale”(short story, 1966).  Philosophy ofmemory, what does it mean for something to be my experience? (Rosen)|
|·        Counter-clock World (novel, 1967). OMG this one is stupid! It’s theopposite of Martin Amis’ Time’s Arrow in terms of depth,meaning, writing, sophistication and coherence – but fun and philosophical andright up my alley. In 1986 time arrow flips: peoplestart calling from their graves to be let out, un-smoking stubs to clean theirlungs…and don’t think about eating and excreting. (Callender)|
|·        Do Androids Dream ofElectric Sheep (novel, 1968; inspired theRidley Scott movie Blade Runner; seebelow)|
|o   There’s the moral isolation from others through an“experience-machine”-like self-programming of emotional states, contrasted withMercer as a kind of Levinasian Other; animal ethics,especially as connected to consumerism and environmentalism; AI stuff; etc.Wonderfully complicated, deep, and wacky – all of which will be surprising ifyou’ve only heard of it by way of BladeRunner. I’ll also go ahead and plug one of my edited volumes, Philip K. Dick and Philosophy (2011), which has chapters onphilosophical issues in a good number of Dick novels and films. (Wittkower)|
|o   I read this for the first time in middle school, never having heardof Blade Runner. Theandroid vs detective plot is great, and of course the book is an excellentmeditation on human nature. But the best part of the story, I think, is thedark, dystopian society Dick portrays in the background of the novel.(Sullivan)|
|·        Do Androids Dream ofElectric Sheep? and “We Can Remember It for YouWholesale” (novel, 1968; short story 1966).  So many Philip K. Dick works to choosefrom!  (Allais)|
|·        Ubik (novel, 1969). As with many of Dick’s novels, his characters inhabita disturbing world where appearances and reality seem to come apart, and out ofmultiple potential versions of reality, it’s not clear what is real, ifanything. (Cameron)|
|·        Flow My Tears, thePoliceman Said (novel, 1974).|
|o   If Dick doesn’t make you paranoid you’re probably not real. Here heexplores celebrity and identity via a drug which snatches the targets of a users thoughts into a parallelreality. (Clarke)|
|o   In a police state, a TV star wakes up to find he is now a nobody.What is “reality,” and whose reality matters? (J. Kaplan)|
|·        Radio Free Albemuth (novel, 1976). Time stopped inthe first century AD, and restarted in 1945. Come up with a theory of time tomake that consistent! (Dever)|
|·        A Scanner Darkly (novel, 1977; also 2006 movie adaptation). An undercover drugenforcement agent loses touch with reality. Who are we, when we pretend to bewho we are not? To whom do we owe loyalty? (J. Kaplan)|
|·        “Imposter” (short story, 1986). PhilipK. Dick at his best, struggling to understand the self and self-understanding.(Bein)|

|Recommended by Eight|
|Greg Egan|
|·        “Learning to Be Me” (short story, 1990).|
|o  Permutation City is great even if it’sphilosophically incoherent, but this is a much tighter piece aboutconsciousness and identity. (Chalmers) |
|o  This may be the best short,fictional introduction to questions of personal identity and consciousness.There are many great ones, but this is chilling and delightful. (Daly)|
|·        “The Infinite Assassin” (1991). How are we related to our counterparts throughout themultiverse? (Kind) |
|·        Permutation City /Diaspora (novels, 1994, 1997). If we could upload our minds into giantcomputers, including duplicating ourselves, backing ourselves up, radicallyaltering our sensory experiences and personalities, what would be theconsequences for personal identity and the meaning of life? (Schwitzgebel)|
|·        Axiomatic (short story collection, 1995).|
|o  Each story in this collectiondevelops a strikingly original idea. In “The Hundred Light-Year Diary”, amethod for sending messages to the past is invented, and everyone learns futurehistory as well as past history, and is issued their life-long diary as soon asthey can read. Rather than investigating free will and fatalism, the storyinvestigates the political role of information. Several stories investigatecomputational alteration or replacement of biological brains and theirconsequences for moral responsibility and personal survival and identity. Someare more comedic. (Easwaran) |
|o  This collection contains manyof my favorite stories ever, including “Hundred Light Year Diary” (bouncingsignals off a time-reversed galaxy gets you answers before you sentquestions…fate, fatalism, free will, time) “Learning to Be Me” (functionalism,personal identity). I’ve used three of the stories in philosophy courses.(Callender)|
|·        “Reasons to be Cheerful” (short story, 1997). Egan, in my pantheon of hard SF writers, playswith the psychology and philosophy of happiness with a protagonist, narrated inthe first person, who of necessity gains the ability to adjust his mentalwell-being moment by moment. (Nichols)|
|·        Diaspora (novel, 1997)|
|o   Living indefinitely long as a godlike digital posthumanis all well and good, and when you run out of physical universe(s) to explore,there’s solace to be had in math. (Mandik)|
|o   A story of software-based posthumans, whocan create their own identities and virtual environments. Explores what lifemight be like when completely freed from biology and massively enhanced bytechnology. (Frankish)|
|Stanislaw Lem|
|·        The Star Diaries, “The Twentieth Voyage”(story in a series, 1957, trans. 1976). A fun storyof time travel, fraught with causality problems and problems of self. (Bein)|
|·        Solaris (novel, 1961; English translation 1970; film adaptation Andrei Tarkovsky, 1972)|
|o   Communication with aliens. What, if anything, is real? Politics ofscience and exploration. (Oppenheimer)|
|o   Astronauts on a station in a distant part of the galaxy confront amassive and deeply inscrutable alien being that may or may not be attempting tocommunicate with them, and people (or rather, reproductions of people) fromtheir pasts, who may in fact be the alien’s attempt to communicate.Unforgettable and genuinely profound. (The 1972 film alters the ending and, tosome degree, the thematic focus, but it is also fabulous and very beautiful inits own right, a true cinematic masterpiece.) (Jollimore)|
|o   Lem exploresissues related to limitations of knowledge and communication, philosophy ofmind and the structure of radically different minds. (Fokt)|
|o   What would it mean to meet a truly alien intelligence? (Prescott)|
|o   Seems wrong not to mention this classic. Great for epistemology andphilosophy of science. (Callender)|
|·        Return from the Stars (novel, 1961; trans. 1980) Can humans live in a utopian society?What is the value of suffering, danger and risk, and what can happen if theyare removed? (Fokt)|
|·        The Cyberiad (story collection, 1965; trans. 1974) A collection ofphilosophically-themed short stories about the adventures of constructorengineers Trurl and Klapauciustrying to out do one another. (Mag Uidhir)|
|·        His Master’s Voice (novel, 1968; English translation 1983)|
|o   One of the best treatment of the untreatable theme of „translation”in the Davidson/Quine areas. People are asked to understand what an alien textmessage is... (Palma)|
|o   A thoughtful and intelligent imagination of “first contact” girdedby a deep pessimism about the possibilities of transcending the conceptualboundaries set by one’s species nature. It would be interesting to read this(and/or Ratner’s Star and/or Solaris) in combinationwith Davidson’s “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme,” etc. (Jollimore)|
|·        The FuturologicalCongress (novel, 1971; trans. 1974)|
|o   On distinguishing reality from hallucination; scepticismand issues in knowledge acquisition and justification. (Fokt)|
|o   It’s The Matrix on drugs (literally) but betterwritten and utterly hilarious. (Mag Uidhir)|
|·        Golem XIV (novel, 1981; trans. 1985). A story from the point of view of an AIwhich achieves consciousness, raises issues in philosophy of mind, andquestions human ethics. (Fokt)|
|·        Wizja lokalna (Local Vision) (novel, 1982 – Polish, not translated) Raises moral issues relatedto artificial intelligences and immortality. (Fokt)|
|·        Fiasco (novel,1986; trans. 1987). Another novel exploring the linguistic and cognitivelimitations on understanding and communicating with truly different, alien lifeforms. (Fokt)|

|Recommended by Seven|
|Isaac Asimov|
|·        “Evidence” (1946). Probes the plausibility of the Turing Test. (Kind)|
|·        I, Robot (short stories, collected 1950)|
|o   Classic short stories in this book, having to do with therelationship between humans and non-human intelligences. It’s not as utopianabout technology as a lot of Asimov’s other work, but despite several incidentsof robots behaving badly, it’s not all Skynet and doom either. (Yap)|
|o   Most of Asimov’s robot’s stories are situated at the beginning ofpositronic robotics and space exploration. Robots are programmed to follow theThree Laws of Robotics. The film I, Robot is also excellent. (Schneider)|
|·        “Breeds There a Man?” (short story,1951).  Before The Matrix and Nick Bostrom, golden ageSF writers had more rough-and-ready ways to explore the idea that our wholereality is a vast experiment performed upon us by near-omnipotent beings.(Silcox)|
|·        The End of Eternity (novel, 1955).  Mostphilosophers like “consistent” time travel with a single timeline, but i love the complex structure here with time police hangingout in metatime. (Chalmers)|
|·        The Gods Themselves (novel, 1972).  What ispersonal identity? (E. Kaplan)|
|·        The Gods Themselves and The End ofEternity (novels,1972 and 1955).  By far his mostinteresting and imaginative work I think. Though my favouriteis The Gods Themselves, forphilosophical interest The End ofEternity is great as it’s about time travel. (Allais)|
| |
|Recommended by Six|
|Margaret Atwood|
|·        A Handmaid’s Tale (novel, 1985)|
|o   How does the role and treatment of women in our society affectsociety? What problems are there with persons of either gender being limited toreproductive purposes? (Roy-Faderman)|
|o   In a near future - and a very close possible world - a theocraticdictatorship has emerged in which women are severely repressed and muststruggle to gain agency and community. (Cameron)|
|o   Ethical issues of a world where fertility is declining, feministcritique of the value of women in society. (Rosen)|
|·        Oryx and Crake (novel, 2003)|
|o   Brilliant genetic engineer Glenn (“Crake”) is disgusted with humanbeings, their violence, and their environmental destructiveness. So he destroysthe human race, and replaces it with a new species, the “Crakers”,which he has designed as a superior replacement. The story is told by the lastsurviving human, who was Crake’s best friend before the apocalypse. (Briggs)|
|o   A challenging vision of another all-too-possible future. (Prescott)|
|·        Oryx and Crake trilogy (novels, 2003-2013). Also postclimate collapse, many ideas about current social and technological trendstaken to extremes. (Allais)|
|Octavia Butler|
|·        “Bloodchild” (short story, 1984)|
|o   Explores the nature of gender roles via a story about an alien racewho need humans for procreative purposes. (Kind)|
|o   Men are forced to bear the progeny of aliens in a gory andpowerfully emotional analogy of motherhood, portrayed as a paradoxicallyenjoyable form of abuse. (Clarke)|
|o   Some questions raised by this short story are: How would it feel tobe a farm animal? What exactly is sexual consent? Is the survival of ourspecies worth any price? (Daly)|
|·        Parable of the Sower (novel, 1993). Gender roles, and the significance of empathy indischarging our responsibilities for each other. (Evnine)|
|·        Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents (novels 1993 and 1998).|
|o   Interesting ideasabout post climate collapse, societal collapse and about religion.  (Allais)|
|o  During achillingly realistic slide into dystopia paired with meditations on race,gender, empathy, and nationalism, a quasi-religion, Earthseed,is founded by the main character and later questioned by her daughter. Should we make space travela long term organizing goal rather than war, economic gain, or politicaldomination? (Mills)|

|Recommended by Five|
|Edwin Abbott|
|·        Flatland (novel, 1884)|
|o   Conceptualization and visualization; imaginability,conceivability, and possibility; social class and gender structure.(Oppenheimer)|
|o   A classic work written from the point of view of 2-dimensionalbeings in a 2-D world (the “author” of the book is “A Square”) upon theirinteraction with the 3rd dimension. Originally, it was renowned for its satireof hierarchical (Victorian) society, but after Einstein, how it handles theidea of there being more dimensions than those with which one is familiarbecame an important element of how it is read. (Keeley)|
|o  A novel set in spaces ofdifferent dimensions. (Blumson)|
|o  The original mind-bender.(Prescott)|
|o  Description of life in a 2dimensional world, social critique of the arbitrariness of social standing andthe class system, references Plato’s cave allegory. (Rosen)|
|Robert A.Heinlein|
|·        “Jerry Was a Man” (short story, 1947). Ponders the issue of human rights for nonhumananimals and what it means for someone to be human, with the protagonist, agenetically-modified chimpanzee. (De Cruz)|
|·        “–All You Zombies–” (shortstory, 1959)|
|o   Classic sci-fi story that involves an especially interesting paradoxof time travel. (Campbell)|
|o   In a world where time travellers areresponsible for going back to ensure that history happens as it did, apotential recruit is forced to grapple with the problem of other minds.(Cameron)|
|o   A looping and incestuous time-travel story. (Blumson)|
|·        The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (novel, 1966). Heinlein’s lunar society exhibits his libertarianideas, as well as the view that there’s no such thing as a free lunch(expressed in the awkward acronym TANSTAAFL) (De Cruz)|
|·        Job: A Comedy of Justice (novel, 1984). C.S. Lewis meets David Lewis. A literalistinterpretation of the Book of Job playing out across multiple actualizedpossible worlds. (De Smedt)|

|o   How important is how we’re made to our personhood? What guidelinesshould there be to using reproductive technologies? What should the limits ofthese uses be, if any? (Roy-Faderman)|
|o   Chronicles the plight of cloned humans (who do not know they areclones) raised for the sole purpose of donating their organs to “ordinary”humans. Sensitive, beautiful, and far-reaching. (Jollimore)|
|o   A contemporary bioethical cautionary tale. (Prescott)|
|o  The narrative perspective ofthe novel is one of its chief strengths. We discover the plot along with thenarrator, so we spend much of the book wondering what’s going on. A keyquestion raised: Do human clones deserve the same rights as other humans? Thenovel strongly suggests that they do. (Daly)|
|o  **spoiler warning**  Although the livesof the protagonists are at the forefront, the story raises ethical issues regardingcloning for organ donation and the status of clones. What is a person? (Rosen)|
|China Miéville|
|·        Embassytown (novel, 2011)|
|o   Philosophy of language! semiotics! impossibility of falsehood! simile vs metaphor!(Oppenheimer)|
|o   A member of a very small set of sci-fi books where the relevantscience is linguistics. It centrally concerns the challenge of communicatingwith an alien race whose language, among other challenging properties, seems tobe one in which one cannot knowingly express a falsehood. (Having learned aboutlying from the humans, the aliens have a kind of Olympic competition to see whocan come as close to lying as possible.) (Weinberg)|
|o   An alien society that cannot speak falsely first learns from humanshow to make similes, and ultimately learns how to lie, changing themirrevocably. (Cameron)|
|o   A novel about people trying to interact with an alien race who thinkand communicate in a fundamentally different manner than us. A moresophisticated take on this concept than the TNG episode Darmok,and with considerably more interest for philosophers of language. (Powell)|
|·        Embassytown and The City &The City (novels, 2011 and 2009). The first is a fun, if a bit clunky, bit ofexploratory philosophy of language. The second is a particularly adventurousinstance of exploratory metaphysics. (Dever)|

|·        Diamond Age: Or, A YoungLady’s Illustrated Primer (novel, 1995). A cyberpunknovel set in a post-scarcity (sort of) world in which any material can beconstructed by nanotechnology “compilers” out of “the Feed”; a supply pipe ofenergy and basic elements. A wealthy engineer creates an AI “primer” book thatwill provide the best possible education for his daughter, by telling herstories that teach her about life and help instill whatever skills she willneed (the book is a combination of AI adaptive scriptwriter that learns whatits person needs, and a remote human actor who gives the script real humanvoice and emotion). The primer falls into the hands of Nell, a slum dweller.Explores the role of education, the economics and class structure of apost-scarcity Earth, the power of those who control the Feed, and artificialintelligence and virtual reality. (Cash)|
|·        The Baroque Cycle (novels, 2003-2004). Set ashistorical novels and developed around the core of interactions between Newtonand Leibniz, explores the origins of modern systems of science and finance incounterpoint with alchemical memes. (Horst)|
|·        Anathem (novel, 2008)|
|o   Academics cut themselves off from causal contact with the world inorder to develop theoretical knowledge independent of social and politicalfads. Trans-world communication plays an important role. (Easwaran)|
|o   At the risk of a major spoiler, this book explores ideas of thequantum multiverse, with the added bonus that some characters are stand-ins forthe views of people like Husserl, Gödel, and Bohr. (Horst)|
|o   In this advanced-tech world, Arbre, “avout” academics are cloistered from “saecuar”society, living simple lives in monastic institutions (“concents”)doing science, philosophy, and studying -- over thousands of years -- the waythe civilizations outside their walls rise and fall. Many of the academics haveviews paralleling Earth philosophers and scientists. A recurring debate betweenadvocates of platonic realism and mathematical formalism plays a role insolving a mystery/problem/potential threat of world-changing scale andsignificance. (Geek fun: identify the Earth philosopher/scientist whose viewsare paralleled.) (Cash)|
|o  A sci-fi adventure bookstarring a philosopher-monk-hero, where major plot twists involve the manyworlds interpretation of QM, and debates over Platonismin metaphysics. No, really. (Weinberg)|
|o  Discusses many philosophicaltopics including parallel worlds discussion of metaphysics. Describes a worldin which modern philosophy is highly valued. (Rosen)|
|Kurt Vonnegut|
|·        Player Piano (novel, 1952). A satire of industrial and cultural automation in thenear future, where technology has rendered most humans superfluous. Still oneof the most intelligent deep critiques of the dangers of technology to be foundin fiction. (Jollimore)|
|·        The Sirens of Titan (novel, 1959).|
|o   A starkly beautiful spiral through loneliness, omniscience and themeaning of life. (Clarke)|
|o   Questions the meaning of life- or lack thereof and free will. Acharacter who is swept up by fate suffers, loves, finds happiness, dies. Socialcritique and the pointlessness of war. (Rosen)|
|·        “Welcome to the MonkeyHouse” (short story, 1968). What are reasonable responses to a populationissue? In what situation, if any, is assisted suicide ethically allowable? Whatare the consequences of different attitudes towards sex and sexuality? (Roy-Faderman)|
|·        Slaughterhouse Five (novel, 1969). Vonnegut at his best, festooned with problems ofethics, causality, and free will vs. determinism. (Bein)|

|o   This book and the series still delivers Mona Lisa-like smiles (andlaughs) to thinking readers from the moment Arthur’s first grabs a towel – anda pint – to the moment when Zaphod asks to “meet themeat” at the Restaurant. (Nichols)|
|o   The babelfish disproves god; the cow wants to be eaten; the total perspective vortex;time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so; and 42. (Chalmers)|
|o   SF comedy classic; tells the story of a “wholly remarkable book”through the story of Arthur Dent, an Earthling whose planet is destroyed tomake room for a hyperspace bypass and his friend Ford Prefect who turns out tobe from a planet near Betelgeuse, and who writes for the book. (Ironically thestory of Arthur Dent is often punctuated by excerpts from the book.) The book’sentire entry on the planet Earth reads “Mostly harmless”. Explores manyphilosophical ideas. See especially the Total Perspective Vortex, a proof ofGod’s existence (which thus proves that He cannot exist), the End of theUniverse, an ethical meat that wants to be eaten, a virtual reality universe,and a supercomputer programmed to compute the Answer to the Ultimate Questionof Life, the Universe, and Everything (philosophers threaten to strike if themachine does their job, until the machine proposes a better idea).

|R. Scott Bakker|
|·        Neuropath and the Prince ofNothing trilogy (novels, 2003-2008). Very philosophically informed. Neuropath is grounded in serious research inneuroscience and philosophy of mind. Prince of Nothing is high fantasy in the spirit, but notthe style, of Tolkien, indebted to both Thucydides and Camus. (Wittkower)|

|·        Labyrinths (esp. “Tlön, Uqbar,and Orbis Tertius”, “TheLibrary of Babel”, and “The Circular Ruins”, short stories, mostly 1940-1949).Every story is philosophically weird and interesting in multiple ways, withrepeating themes of infinitude, temporality, repetition, and metaphysicalidealism. (Schwitzgebel) |
|·        “Tlon,Uqbar, Orbis Tertius” (short story, 1941). This short story is a beautiful illustration ofa particularly strange form of anti-realism. (Blumson)|
|·        “On Rigor in Science” (short story, 1946). I want to use this one-paragraph short story ina paper on idealization. It brings up an empire in which map-making has“advanced” such that the only acceptable map of the empire is one of the exactsame scale as the empire itself. (Yap)|
|·        “The Immortal” (1947). An intriguing exploration of why immortality may not bequite what we’d bargained for; pairs well with Bernard Williams’ “The Makropulos Case: Reflections on the Tedium of Immortality.”(Kind)|

|·        Dandelion Wine (a collection of connected short stories, 1957). Possibly the mostcharming existential novel you will find. Douglas Spaulding, 12 years old,living in Green Town Illinois in 1927, realizes that he is alive. But with thatcomes the realization that one day he also will die. A rumination about what itmeans to really live, love, and be happy. It’s not obviously SF, but by an SFauthor, and includes a time machine, an attempt to build a virtual reality“happiness machine” (c.f. Nozick’s “experiencemachine”), a tragic love story about a reincarnated lover, a ready-to-diegreat-grandma’s thoughts on immortality, a 9 year old’s inspiring thoughts onhappy endings, a serial killer horror story and the need for scary stories thatadd danger to life, a mechanical gypsy fortune-teller who cries for help, andbottling all the joys of a summer day into a bottle of dandelion wine. (Cash)|
|David Brin|
|·        Kiln People (novel, 2002)|
|o   I also found Brin’s uplift trilogy a lotof fun but this one is more philosophical in ideas about personal identity.(Allais)|
|o   There is technology for creating clones that can live for a day, andwhich have most or all of the capacities of the individual. The novelinvestigates consequences for economics, privacy, politics, and health, in themidst of a noir set in future Los Angeles. (Easwaran)|
|o  Another hard-sf ‘Killer B’ (like Bear—seealso: Benford) from the 80’s who didn’t make theWesleyan cut. Brin is not so strong in the shortstory department (so his exclusion from a short story collection ispardonable.) Kiln People is a novelfrom 2002, but I rate it philosophically higher than his better-known Upliftbooks. Kiln came in second for, like,every prize. It coulda’been a contender for classic novel status! If you are teaching personal identity stuff and you want Derek Parfit’s Reason andPersons, but a murder mystery, this is for you. Brinis on my list twice, not because he’s so great as all that, just because if Iassign essays or criticism from fiction writers, I like to sample their actualfiction as well. And I assign Brin’s criticism. Seethe next entry. This semester I’m planning to recommend (not require) Kiln. (Holbo)|
|o  What if you could temporarily put yourconsciousness into a disposable copy of yourself, which could then run variouserrands for you, and whose consciousness would be re-absorbed by yours after 24hours? The copies are self-destructing: if they don’t re-absorb by 24 hours,then they disintegrate, so in general, the copies strongly identify as the person they are copies of,expecting to live on via the re-absorption. But then again... what if you weresuch a copy, and you realized that you are now in a circumstance where youwon’t ever get to rejoin the original? Really interesting exploration offusion/fission and personal identity; it’s written in what one might call thefirst-person-singular-plural. (Weinberg)|

|·        Children of Men (novel, 1992; Alfonso Cuarón movie, 2006)|
|o   Centers on themes that have recently been explored by Sam Scheffler about the role of the ongoing existence of humanityin giving meaning to the life of an individual. (Easwaran)|
|o   Social criticism and theological reflection focusing on the resultsof mass infertility. (De Cruz)|
|o   What would life on Earth be like if human beings suddenly lost theability to have children? This novel is a compelling and disturbing imaginingof the extinction of the human race that feels, to me, much more vivid and realthan nearly any other apocalyptic work of fiction I can think of. (Samuel Scheffler cites the novel in his book, Death and the Afterlife;reading the two in conjunction would be productive.) The 2006 film, directed byAlfonso Cuarón, is also excellent. (Jollimore)|
|o   While there are a number of plot differences between the film andthe book, both do an excellent job of investigating reactions to an existentialthreat to humanity arising from total infertility. (Powell)|

|·        Accelerando (novel, 2005)|
|o   How much computer enhancement and dissociation of the self iscompatible with remaining human? what are the differences between a softwarealgorithm, a legal system, an organism, and a religion, and can all of thempotentially be conscious? (Easwaran)|
|o   Nothing else that I’ve read comes as close to this in depicting whatliving through the technological singularity would be like; “mind-bendingfuture shock” is an insufficiently hyperbolic superlative. (Mandik)|
|o   Uploaded minds; post-humanism; the singularity. What is a person,anyway? (Oppenheimer)|

|Iain M. Banks|
|·        “The State of the Art” (short story collection, 1989). The Culture (featured in many ofBanks’ SF/Space Opera novels), is a post-scarcity libertarian technological utopia,in which AI minds take care of just about all the heavy thinking and planning,and humanoid inhabitants can do and be whatever they want. The theme throughmany of these novels is how messed up people can still be in such a utopia. ACulture ship and its human crew discover Earth in 1977, at the height of theCold War and on the brink of nuclear armageddon. Ournarrator argues for contact. Another wants to defect to Earth (inconceivably tomany of his colleagues). Another argues that the whole insane planet should bedestroyed with a micro-black hole. The limits of utopia, the beauty of flawedhumanity, the role of scarcity and risk and fragility in human life, and thepossibility that important aspects of life might be lost when one can have anddo whatever one likes, for as long as one likes. (Cash)|
|·        Surface Detail (novel, 2010)|
|o   If we plot ideas-per-page on the x-axis and quality of writing onthe y, Banks’ novels exist in an upper-right-corner world of their own, andthis probing novel about punishment, religion and the state is no exception.(Nichols)|
|o   Once any civilization develops realistic artificial realities, inwhich people can upload themselves and live, religious fanatics inevitably usethis tech to make sure that there really is a Hell, in which “deserving” peoplecan now be subjected to unending torture and torment. A war is being fought ina series of different virtual realities, to determine whether these Hellsshould exist. The anti-hell side (including the above mentioned Culture) is losing.Should the virtual war be brought into the real world, if it means savingmillions of intelligent beings from eternal torment?

|Fred Hoyle|
|·        The Black Cloud (novel, 1957).|
|o   Begins as an impending-disaster-for-earth story, but introduces atwist: the giant cloud approaching earth is conscious and is surprised to findother conscious beings in the universe. Consciousness, multiple realizability, the works. (Bernstein)|
|o  The late British astronomer’snovel starts out looking like a novel about a disaster from deep space, buttakes a turn to explore the prospects of communication with an alienintelligence very different from ourselves. (Horst)|

|·        A Hole in Space (short stories, collected 1974). The master of ‘soft’ (sociological)sci fi, Niven was visionary at thinking through thehuman consequences of new technologies. Teleportation here acts as sociallighter fluid, enabling the formation of dangerously volatile ‘flash mobs’, aswell as adding new depths a to murder mystery challenge. (Clarke)|

|Mary Shelley|
|·        Frankenstein (novel, 1818)|
|·        It seems almost unnecessary tolist this work, which is such a widely read classic. Shelley’s tale of the“modern Prometheus” does an exceptional job of raising questions about thenature of humanity and the ethics of creating life. (Powell)|
|·        So standard you might fail totry it. Try it! I’m a historicist, so I bounce off Brian Aldiss’ well-knownFrankenstein-is-first critical line. A nice teaching trick: ask the kids totell the story of Frankenstein before they read the novel for the first time.So what’s the philosophical difference between what we know is going to bethere, and what actually turns out to be there? Also, this is maybe the singlemost often adapted work of sf, in a broad sense. (So many artificial beingsconstructed, so unwisely, since Shelley’s day.) (Holbo)|

What is the function/advantage of intelligence?This story involves an encounter between a group of scientists and a(apparently) non-intelligent, superorganism species that resemble earthlysocial insects. Sterling’s piece looks at other forms that intelligent lifemight take. (Keeley)|
|·        “The Beautiful and the Sublime” (shortstory, 1987).  In this story’s version ofthe future, scientific inquiry is the exclusive province of genius AIs. Theprotagonist is a harmless, but hyperbolic fop who spends all his spare timebreathlessly theorizing about aesthetics, and can’t quite manage to understandwhy some of his friends might find such a life unsatisfying. A very subtle andcheerfully malevolent piece of cultural criticism. (Silcox)|

|·        Holy Fire (novel, 1997).  An ingeniouslyconstructed novel about youth, aging, and the ambiguous benefits of socializedmedicine. The near-future that Sterling envisages is rich with interestingpersonalities and technologies, and his protagonist, who starts the story abouthalf a century older than she is by the end of it, is a memorable character.(Silcox)|

James Tiptree, Jr. is the best female sf author who isn’t namedUrsula. Or maybe she’s just the best. But the Wesleyan editors, in theirwisdom, include what I regard as one of her most ‘meh’ stories. No accountingfor taste, but I would recommend her otherstories, and every sf and philosophy class should include one from Tiptree.(Also, I suppose Her Smoke Rose UpForever goes well, in a titular sense, with Bear’s The Wind From A Burning Woman. Not that Irecommend being pyromaniacal about it. But maybe youhave a St. Joan thing?) (Holbo)|

|Greg Bear|
|·        The Wind FromA Burning Woman (short stories, 1978-1983).  Bearis first and foremost a novelist, and many of his novels are philosophicallyfantastic and would be eminently teachable. But in the classroom there is alimit on the number of novels you can assign. Short stories are the way to go.I pick Wind, rather than, say, Tangents, because it contains “Petra”,about the day the laws of nature change. Very grue.But medieval, if that’s your cup of after time-t and/or you want to get Goodmanand the Good God of Augustine out of the way at the same time. I list Bear tocompensate for his unjust omission from the Wesleyan. I think their picks fromthe 1980’s are non-representative. (I have notactually assigned Bear in my own class but am planning to do “Petra” thiscoming semester.)  Bear deserves to behigher on the list of recommended authors than he currently stands. (Holbo)|

While the UN is deliberating about what to do, the Jesuits recognize amessage from God in the circumstances of the discovery, and so organize asecret Mission to this world.

Alternatingchapters set at the beginning and end of the mission explore how this disasterhappened. Themes of interspecies interpretation (and misinterpretation), whatthe existence of an alien civilization means for religion (is our God alsotheir God?), interpretation of God’s will (if He so obviously wanted us to gothere, how could He let it become such a disaster)?

|·        Hominids (novel,2002; also Humans and Hybrids, 2003). Hominids is the first book in the Neanderthal Parallaxtrilogy, in which a doorway to aparallel universe opens up in Sudbury, Ontario. Yes, Sudbury. In the paralleluniverse, Neanderthals became dominant rather than us. It’s interestingthinking through the differences in the family culture of each group, sinceNeanderthals in the other universe have two partners, one male and one female.(Yap)|
|·        Mindscan (novel, 2005). A fellow with an inoperable brain tumor attempts toupload his brain onto a computer and learns the hard way that uploading is nomeans of survival. Sawyer astutely depicts the metaphysical, legal and ethicalchallenges that arise.

|·        Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, The Time Wanderers(novel, 1985; English translation 1987). Ever since Tolstoy, the greatest Russian writers have shown an almostsupernatural ability to understand and dramatize the tragic sweep of their ownnation’s history. This short novel is a reflection on the limitations andparadoxes of planned societies, and the myths about human equality that canboth sustain and undermine them. If Soviet censors had been paying any seriousattention to SF when this was published, the Strugatskybrothers would certainly have been sent to Siberia. Small mercies! (Silcox)|

|Daniel Suarez (Leinad Zeraus)|
|·        Daemon and FreedomTM (novels,2006 and 2010). Originally written as a single work, but eventually publishedin two volumes, these two books can be seen as an exploration of theimplications of a number of technologies currently on the horizon (with somecoming to pass even in the few years since they were written). Written in theform of a cyberpunk thriller, AI, drones, 3D-printing, self-replicating autonomousmachine warfare, video games, & virtual reality are all thrown into themix, as an AI begins to organize a conspiracy to control (or at leastsignificantly change) the world. Many themes in philosophy of technology are atplay. (Keeley)|
|·        Influx (novel, 2014). Justly compared to Crichton, Suarez’s page-turningplotting does not come at the expense of intelligent protagonists andantagonists, thank God; but make no mistake, this exciting but thoughtful bookis much more than aisle-seat fodder. (Nichols)|

In this short story, Wells describes anexplorer, Nuñez, who accidentally discovers a valleyin the Andes separated off from the rest of the world containing a populationof humans who have all lost their sight several generations earlier. As such,they no longer believe in the phenomenon of vision. The story follows Nuñez’s frustrating attempts to first rule them (after all,in the country of the blind…) and then later even to convince them that he hasaccess to a sense that they do not have. How would one go about convincing agroup of extremely functional blind people, living in an environment that theyhave adapted to their needs, of the existence of the visual world? Wells arguesthat it would be harder than one might initially imagine. (Keeley)|

|o   Set in a very far future capitalist utopia, about to be threatenedby a very different form of society. Questions about identity, humanity, socialcontrol are implicit, and there are even clear and fairly compelling arguments,mostly drawn from Stoic sources, about the rational roots of ethics. (Clark)|
|o   A well-thought-out posthuman libertarianutopia. (Also a deeply sexist novel, I'm afraid.) (Baker)|

|Tom Godwin, “The Cold Equations” (shortstory, 1954). Classic lifeboat ethics problem, but made very personal, not atall abstract. (Bein)|

|Ryo Hanmura, “Tansu” (short story, 1997). A magical tansu, orchest of drawers, motivates people to sit on top of it all night, chantingmechanically. When asked, people transformed by the tansuunanimously describe the the activity as deeplyfulfilling, yet the narrator finds something frightening in the idea of beingtransformed. (Briggs)|
|Nalo Hopkinson, Brown Girl in the Ring (novel, 1998). This book has everything you didn’t know you wantedin a book: three generations of kickass women, post-apocalyptic Toronto, andsome Afro-Caribbean magic. That’s all I need to tell you, now go read itimmediately. I think it’s one of the best and most underrated works of feministspeculative fiction out there. (Yap)|
|Hugh Howey, Wool (short story series, 2011-2013). Not great writing, but fun, fast and original. Plato in the Cavethemes, trolley problem dilemmas. (Callender)|
|Henry James, “TheJolly Corner” (short story, 1908). Revisiting his childhood home, a middle-agedman confronts his monstrous alter ego and achieves a sort of redemption. Raisesquestions about choice, responsibility, character, and personal identity. (Fora different take on the same theme, see Basil Dearden’s1970 film, The Man Who HauntedHimself, starring Roger Moore.) (Frankish)|

|Johann Kepler, “Somnium” (novel, 1608). An incrediblestory by one of the most important scientists in world history, Kepler(1571-1630) represents a trip to the moon according to extrapolation from histhen-current, accurate, and highly non-standard scientific knowledge. (Thereal-life story behind “Somnium” and what it costKepler personally is more gripping.) (Nichols)|
|John Kessel,“Stories for Men” (short story, 2002). Fascinating piece about gender. Examines a civilizationin which women are privileged in something like the way our civilizationprivileges men. (Baker)|
|Stephen King, The Stand (novel,1978). The world has been ravaged by a disastrous plague called Captain Trips.The novel charts the path of various survivors who must choose sides in anapocalyptic battle. But the description doesn’t do justice to King’s richlyimagined characters and twisty plot. (Sullivan)|
|Nancy Kress, “NanoComes to Clifford Falls” (short story, 2006). Nano destroys scarcity, work is no longernecessary, society falls apart. (Wittkower)|
|Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, “Quadraturin” (short story, 192-something). There’s a superabundance of sciencefiction about weird physics and metaphysics of time, but a disappointing dearthof the same with space. This is an exception. (Dever)|
|Madeline L’Engle, AWrinkle in Time / A Wind in the Door / ASwiftly Tilting Planet (novels, 1962-1978). This mayhave been my first introduction to science fiction as a child, and while it isnot the most intellectually challenging series about time travel (anddimensional travel, in the case of the memorable Cherubim that is both singularand plural), it is perhaps still the most memorable and endearing. (Horst)|
|Jonathan Lethem, Gun, WithOccasional Music (novel, 1994).  Lethemtakes up the Philip K. Dick mantle in about as stylish and sophisticated a wayas anyone ever has. PKD is a giant, of course, and I assume you are teachingsome. (What are you? A fool?) So maybe you want to talk about the literarylegacy of that line? Gun, With OccasionalMusic. It’s got an Ubik-y,VALIS-y, Scanner Darkly-y paranoid noir-vibe.In a weird way it would go great with Brin’s Kiln People (see #5). Or his Upliftnovels, come to think of it. (That kangaroo!) A murder mystery that is reallyan exploration of personal identity, only in this case the technical novum is notqualitative duplication of selves but deliberate (often pharmaceutical)self-design. Yet Lethem is stylistically the antipodes of Brin.So hereby you get at that no-nonsense hard-sf thing that goes back to Campbelland Gernsback, vs. the literary New Wave that startsin the 60’s. You can’t teach the history of sf without touching on that, I say.(Holbo)|
|Doug Liman, Edge of Tomorrow (movie,2014). A mysterious brain controls a huge number of robots that occupy Europe.An American journalist finds himself in the position of being killed a numberof times retaining the memory traces of the killings before his death. On whatfree will entails in terms of what (Borges &) H. Frankfurt would call “thealternatives”. (Palma)|
|Richard Matheson, I Am Legend (novel, 1954). If you’re the last surviving human in avampire-apocalypse, does it make sense to want to survive? And who is themonster, to be feared, in a new world populated by vampires? (De Cruz)|
|Will McIntosh, Soft Apocalypse (novel, 2011).  An extremelypessimistic dystopian novel that manages to avoid the usual libertarianfantasies of noble individuals being persecuted by a demonic state. McIntosh’sapocalypse is the kind can only be blamed on humanity at large. (Silcox)|
|Stephenie Meyer, BreakingDawn (novel, 2008): sketches the perfect postmortem human body asoutlined in the hereafter of e.g., Aquinas. (De Smedt)|
|David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas (novel, 2004). There is a distinctive Mitchell-style – complexworlds where everything is secretly interconnected and paranoia is completelyjustified. Cloud Atlas is his best, especially in the middlechapters when he essentially invests a new dialect to describe life in acatastrophic time. (Sullivan)|
|Elizabeth Moon, The Speed of Dark (novel, 2002). The protagonist is a scientist with autism in anear-future world in which there may be a “cure” for his condition. Thequotation marks are there because one of the central issues has to do withwhether autism is a condition that in fact needs curing. I don’t think I’dheard of the idea of neurodiversity when I read this, but it strikes me asexactly the idea under consideration. (Yap)|
|Michael Moorcock,“Pale Roses” (short story, 1974). While we think that post-humanity will overridemost of our base evolutionary motivations, this literary story raises profoundquestions about the meaning of a human life through a setting in whichhuman-like characters are virtually immortal and have nearly limitlesspowers... but still desperately want to be invited to parties. (Nichols)|

|Robert Reed, “A Billion Eves” (shortstory, 2006).  An imaginative take onsome feminist themes. Gives the central conceit of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland andPamela Sargent’s The Shore of Womenjust a tiny extra nudge, with the help of Lewisianmodal metaphysics. (Silcox)|
|Alastair Reynolds, trilogy starting with Blue Remembered Earth (novels, 2012-2015).  Fun trilogy in which Africa leads the spacerace, with different forms of consciousness and intelligence including elephantsand machines.|
|Leonard Richardson, Constellation Games (novel, 2012). Aliens make first contact, and Ariel Blum’s firstreaction is to hope that they’ll let us play their video games. They do. Thenovel is much better than this premise would lead you to expect. Examinesissues in social/political philosophy concerning scarcity of resources (andpost-scarcity societies), anarchism and social organization, the (dis)value ofimmortality, and the role of art and games in human life. (Powell)|
|Kim Stanley Robinson, Aurora (novel, 2015).  A beautiful, melancholicwork of hard scientific speculation and philosophical inquiries on artificialintelligence, narrative theories of personal identity, and whether it’secologically plausible or ethically desirable to colonize other solarsystems.  The ship is one of my all timefavorite characters. (Mills)|
|Karen Russell, Vampires in the Lemon Grove (shortstories, collected 2013). A collection of beautiful short stories, withelements of fantasy and horror used to draw out insights about very realemotions. The first two stories are fascinating. The last one, devastating.(Sullivan)|
|Antoine deSaint-Exupery, TheLittle Prince (novel, 1943). This novel contains the most charming counterexamplesto the sufficiency of resemblance for representation. (Blumson)|
|Jose Saramago, “The Centaur” (short story, 1978, English translation by Nadine Gordimer, 2004).An old centaur, oppressed by the human population, and frustrated by thestruggle between his horse part and his human part, returns home to the sea.(Briggs)|

|Star Wars On Trial, David Brin et al. (non-fiction anthology, 2006)Resolved: Stars Wars is crap and thecause of the ever-increasing crapification of sf.That’s pretty much it. Then the various authors line up and go at it, hammerand tongs, pro and con. This book is fun, available in a cheap Kindle edition(as of this writing) and extremely helpful for teaching-by-example a particularstyle of writing: informal, opinionated, argumentative (in all senses) personalessays. This is also a good book for bridging the literary-vs-film gap, if youneed something to help you over that hump; and to help address the historicallyhuge phenomenon of Stars Wars—somethingcuriously invisible if you are just using, say, the Wesleyan anthology. At acertain point sf became mostly not onpaper. So is that good, bad or indifferent? (Holbo)|
|Rachel Swirsky,“Grand Jeté (The Great Leap)” (short story, 2014). A retired AIresearcher’s twelve-year-old daughter is dying of cancer. As an act of love(?), he builds a duplicate of her.

Exploration of issues in feminist ethics and philosophy of science: Should we abide by abstract rules andsanitized observation or should we also rely on lived experience, particularjudgments, and direct interaction? (Mills)|
|J. R. R. Tolkien, “Ainulindalë” (in The Silmarillion,published 1977). Tolkien’s Neo-Platonic creation myth puts the rest of thestories about Middle Earth in a distinctly different cosmic context, hints ofwhich can be seen in the better-known works only after one has read the cosmic“backstory”. (Horst)|
|Harry Turtledove, “Getting Real” (shortstory, 2009).  In the near future, theUSA is in the economic and cultural thrall of China because American citizensare hopelessly addicted to foreign VR technology. A very edgy, self-consciouslyallegorical piece of political SF. (Silcox)|
|Catherynne Valente, Palimpsest (novel,1959). A city is transmitted through physical touch and is only able to bevisited by those who have been infected. Physicalism. (Bernstein)|

|David FosterWallace, Infinite Jest (novel, 1996). Philosophy by virtue of mentioning “Montague Grammarand the Semantics of Physical Modality”, science fiction by virtue of being setin the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, fun by virtue of includingbasically everything in between. (Dever)|
|Jo Walton, The Just City (novel, 2015).  Time traveling goddessAthena tries to set up Plato’s Republic in the pre-Homeric Mediterraneanworld.  Socrates shows up.  Hijinks and philosophical ruminationsensue. (Mills)|
|Sarah Waters, The Little Stranger (novel, 2009). How well do we know ourselves? (Evnine)|
|Wim Wenders, Untilthe End of the World (movie, 1991).  Compared to the usual orgies of explosions,light saber duels, and last minute races to save the galaxy, there’s somethingabout the laid-back, slightly spacey tone of this film that gives itconsiderable novelty value. It’s also one of the earliest movies to depict ahigh-tech future in which the paint still sometimes peels off the walls andairplane engines still sometimes cut out in mid-flight. The last third of thestory, in which characters become addicted to handheld devices that depicttheir previous nights’ dreams, is curiously prophetic. (Silcox)|
|The Wesleyan Anthology ofScience Fiction, Arthur B. Evans et al., eds. (anthology, 2010).  When I was firstplanning to teach SF and Philosophy I fretted long and fruitlessly about whichanthology to make into the spine of my syllabus. There are an awful lot ofchoices—new and old, cheap and expensive. Many of them are very good. Still, Ihad a perfectionist temptation to make my own from scratch. But it’s better togive the kids some onepublished collection they can have and hold. I decided the Wesleyan was best ofthe lot. My personal dissents from the editors’ selections could be turned frombugs into teaching features as we went along. (You’re never going to beperfectly happy with someone else’s anthology about a subject close to yourheart, when it comes to teaching that subject. It’s like using someone else’stoothbrush. Well, deal with it.)  Some ofmy choices below are how-to-fix the Wesleyan tips (by my lights). One fix toobig for any top-10 list: the Wesleyan isAnglophone—i.e. mostly Americans and Brits. That is a defensible editorialfocus, and is tolerably clear from the Table of Contents, if not the cover. Youcan’t be everything to everyone, plus everywhere at once. (If you wantsomething more international, the very new TheBig Book of Science Fiction, edited by the Vandermeers,looks a solid option.) (Holbo)|
|Roger Williams, The Metamorphosis of PrimeIntellect (novel, 1994) A virtual god, subservient to Asimov’s laws ofrobotics, emerges from the technological singularity, and the ensuing cosmicpaternalism puts every human into a heaven they desperately want out of,despite (or because of) all the sex and ultraviolence. (Mandik)|
|Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Nienasycenie[Insatiability] (novel, 1927). Excellent onmind control: an Asian army controls brains by murtib’ing a pill making pliant subjects. (Palma)|
|John Wyndham, The Day of the Triffids (novel,1951). Giant deadly shrubs ambulate around a London riven by a plague ofblindness. Moody, scary, tense, dark. An early pioneer of biological scifi, Wyndham reminds us that plants can be evil too.(Clarke)|
|Charles Yu, How to Live Safely in a Science FictionalUniverse(novel, 2010). Only 93 percent of the laws of physicswere installed in this universe. People time travel, but mostly in saddesperate attempts to change the past. Yu, the narrator and character in thebook, is a low level technician whose job is to stop them. Cool send-up of timetravel books, but very human story. (Callender)|
|Pamela Zoline, “The Heat Death of the Universe” (short story, 1967). Avant-garde writing, and genre-challenging,since it does not have most (any?) of the usual marks of science fiction.Concerns the uselessness of scientific knowledge in the face of existentialdespair and the experience of meaninglessness. (Wittkower)|

|o   Can an AI be a person, in the moral sense or legal sense? In thisepisode, a scientist wishes to disassemble the android (and Second Lieutenant)Data, a procedure that might kill him. The scientist goes as far as arguingthat Data is not a person, but property (and hence, has no right toself-determination). A trial is held to determine Data’s status. (Keeley)|
|o   The trial to determine whether the Android Data is a person or theproperty of Star Fleet provides the context for an engaging exploration ofpersonhood and artificial life. (Horst)|
|·        “Who Watches the Watchers” /“First Contact” / “Thine Own Self” (TV episodes, 1989/1991/1994):The prime directive (non-interference with less advanced civilizations) is oneof the most fascinating elements from Star Trek.

|o   AI , the problem ofother minds... does anyone really need BladeRunner glossed at this point?(Weinberg)|
|o   Biologically engineered artificial intelligence “replicants”are indistinguishable from humans in almost every way. But they are not seen as“persons”. Humans fear them, and have banned them from Earth, they are onlyused off-world slave labor. They also have a four-year life-span. The maincharacter, Deckard, is a Blade Runner, whose job is to hunt and “retire” any replicants found on Earth. A group of them have returned toEarth, because they are nearing four years, and don’t want to die. Are theyreally alive, and deserving of respect and autonomy? Or are they mere machines,that can be “retired” with impunity? Explores the important ethical dimensionsof AI, especially critiquing the idea that humans are special as pure hubris,motivated by an unjustified belief in the “supremacy” of the biological overthe artificial. (See also Battlestar Galactica (2004-9), Bicentennial Man, and Star Trek TNG’s “Measure of aMan” episode). (Cash)|
|o   Covers issues in philosophy of mind: consciousness and thepossibility of artificial intelligence. Also, an illustration of film asphilosophy (Mulhall, 2008).  In OnFilm (2008, 2nd edition),Stephen Mulhall contends that there is aphilosophical debate about the nature of mortality between Leon (a replicant) and Deckard (a blade runner hired to “retire”Leon), Ch. 20, Director’s Cut DVD. This is also discussed in the Philosophy Bites episode, “Stephen Mulhallon Film as Philosophy.”) (Campbell)|
|o   This film is a cinematic masterpiece.  Set in the near future a dystopian LosAngeles it treats the topic of the sentience of androids with great sensitivityand features one of the richest endings in film (if you ask me). Dick’s noveladds major elements to the story that the film does not capture. Still, thefilm is excellent in its own right. (DoAndroids Dream of Electric Sheep? is also recommended.)  (Schneider)|
|o   Based on a Philip K. Dick novel, but with more philosophical depththan the book. It sparks at least these two great philosophical questions:Could androids be people? and What would you ask or say to your creator, if youwere really angry about the human condition? (Daly)|

|o    The dude assumes the identityof a superior being in order to travel in time (space-time & the issuesaround the so called personal identity). (Palma)|

|o   In a world where memories can be implanted and erased, a manstruggles to know who he is and what is real. (Cameron)|
|o   Themes of memory and identity; illusion and reality. Who are youreally? and what is “real” anyway? Quaid dreams about Mars. He tries resolvingthis by taking a virtual vacation involving installing memories of a spy-themedadventure to Mars. Quaid emerges to realize he might be a spy who had had hismemory erased, and who has mistakenly believed he was an ordinary guy. But isthis really happening, or is the whole thing taking place in the virtualvacation? Who is Quaid “really”; a spy/assassin who thought he was an ordinaryguy, or an ordinary guy who used to be a spy/assassin, or just an ordinary guydreaming he is a spy (who used to be an assassin)? What matters more, who we“really” are, or who we choose to be? (Cash)|

|o   Not only the most influential movie about virtual reality, but onethat implicitly poses interesting questions about what counts as “real”, as theMatrix-world is both the world we assume to be reality and is thoroughlyintersubjective. (Horst)|
|o   still the best brain-in-vat and virtual reality movie, and it raisesalmost every issue in philosophy. (Chalmers)|
|·        The Matrix; The MatrixReloaded; The Matrix Revolutions (movies, 1999 & 2003). Deal with a spectrum of philosophicalissues, especially knowledge vs. skepticism, realism vs. antirealism, free willand determinism, and subjectivity vs. objectivity about meaning and value.(Compare Cypher’s choice from The Matrix DVD, Ch. 19, with Robert Nozick’s experience machine thought experiment, Anarchy, State, and Utopia,1974).

|·        eXistenZ (movie, 1999). The story revolves around anvirtual reality game in which you play a part in a story about a plot to murderthe designer of a virtual reality game (and take a guess what the topic of thegame within a game is!). This movie came out the same year as The Matrix and if you ever wondered what mighthave happened if they had explored the possibility of a Matrix running insidethe Matrix, this is your movie. This film pairs well with Descartes’ Meditations by asking how would you know thatyou were in “reality” as opposed to a well-designed immersive video game? Italso explores a number of Sartrean themes (hence, thetitle) concerning the nature of free will and the roles we adopt in life.(Keeley)|
|·        eXistenZ and other millennium-end movies about skepticism (The Matrix / 13thFloor / Dark City)  (movies, 1998-1999). Existenz maybe the best film of that list, but 13thFloor and Dark City, though lesswell-known, each contain interesting sections dramatizing what it really wouldfeel like to slowly come to think that a skeptical hypothesis may actually betrue. Some exploration (though not particularly well worked out) of therelationship between memory and personal identity in Dark City as well. (Weinberg)|
|Terry Gilliam|
|·        Brazil (movie, 1985): A very dark, very funny dystopian film that exploresthe individual vs. the state, and whose conclusion has some interestingconnections with Nozick’s Experience Machine. Theexcellent and very witty script was largely written by British playwright TomStoppard. (Jollimore)|
|·        Twelve Monkeys (movie, 1995). An example of the no-change view of time travel,where people travel to the past but there are no alterations of past events.(See David Lewis, “The Paradoxes of Time Travel” (1976); J. Richard Gott; John Carroll et. al.) (Campbell)|

|o   Clementine erases the memories of her relationship with Joel, soJoel tries to have the same procedure. But as his memories begin to disappear,he has a change of heart and tries to escape the procedure. (Schneider)|
|o  A thoughtful, disturbing, andfunny exploration of some of the possibilities, implications, and dangers ofmemory-altering technology. (Jollimore)|
|Spike Jonze|
|·        Being John Malkovich (movie, 1999; written by Charlie Kaufman, who also wrote Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; seeabove). A fanciful exploration of issues in personal identity. John Cusack’scharacter discovers a portal that lets you experience the world from theperspective of actor John Malkovich. It’s fun to get students to explore what’sincoherent in how this process works, according to the film. Also, you can pairthis movie with Daniel Shaw’s “On Being Philosophical and Being John Malkovich, whichexplores the questions of whether and how a film can be “philosophical” or “dophilosophy”. Be warned that this film depicts violence towards women andanimals. Further, one of the main characters (albeit not a sympathetic one)expresses trans-phobic views. (Keeley)|
|·        Her (movie, 2013). The single most believable cinematic portrayal of thequotidian consequences of AGI. (Bakker)|
|Andrei Tarkovsky (also adapted Stanislaw Lem’s Solaris in1972 and Boris & Arkady Strugatsky’s Roadside Picnic in 1979; see above)|
|·        Stalker (movie, 1979). People are led to a place which is counterfactuallysomething in which wishful thinking is successful. They need a guide (the‘stalker’). (Palma)|
|·        Sacrifice (movie, 1986). A man makes an irrational personal sacrifice in orderto prevent a nuclear war. A poetic film that is open to many interpretations(including religious ones), but which is broadly about how we give meaning toour lives. (Frankish)|

|Black Mirror, “Be Right Back” (TV show, 2013). Digitalsimulacra of the recently departed may be exactly what the grief-stricken don’twant but can’t help but seek. (Mandik)|
|Adam Cadre, Photopia (interactive fiction, 1998). Probably the most famous and influential work of interactive fiction.Not exactly a time-travel story, but the use of flashbacks makes it feel thatway. A masterpiece of technologically-enhanced storytelling that’s also humaneand heartbreakingly sad. (Silcox)|
|Mike Cahill, Another Earth (movie, 2011). The appearance of a duplicate earth brings hope to apromising young student that a tragic accident she’s caused may have beenaverted on the twin earth. (Brophy)|

|Cameron Crowe, Vanilla Sky (movie, 2001). A wealthy playboy faces a horrible accident andarranges to be placed in a cryonic sleep for 150 years, where he lives invirtual reality. The simulation is not without glitches, and the visit from thetech support representative in virtual reality is priceless. The film is acolorful illustration of external world skepticism. (Schneider)|
|Doctor Who, “The Aztecs” (TV serial, 4 episodes, 1964).The Doctor, a time-traveler, takes his companions Barbara, Ian, and Susan tothe Aztec Empire in the 15th Century. Barbara is mistaken for the goddess Yetaxa, and immediately put in charge of the empire.

|Richard Kelly, Donnie Darko (movie, 2001). An example of the many-worlds interpretation of timetravel, where time travel to the past requires travel to a different possibleworld that branches from the actual world. (See David Deutsch; J. Richard Gott; John Carroll et. al., A Time Travel Dialogue, 2014.)(Campbell)|
|Nigel Kneale, TheYear of the Sex Olympics (TV play, 1968). Depicts afuture in which an elite pacify and control the rest of the population throughsensationalist reality television. Themes of hedonism, populism, and the roleof the mass media. Parallels with Plato’s case against the poets. (Frankish)|
|Stanley Kubrick, A Clockwork Orange (movie, 1971). Great for discussions about free will, moralresponsibility, and punishment. One of the few films that asks the question:Can you be praiseworthy if you could not have done otherwise? (Campbell)|
|Fritz Lang, Metropolis andWilliam Cameron Menzies and H.G. Wells, ThingsTo Come (movies, 1927and 1936). They go together.  If you areteaching SF film you have to teach Lang’s Metropolis.It’s the first special effects blockbuster, which failed (it lost money). It’sthe first glossy triumph of sexy style over philosophical substance (that istrying to be philosophical, despite succumbing to its own sexy siren song ofstyle.) It’s the first blockbuster dystopia. It’s dumb (which might trick youinto thinking you can skip it, but you would be an idiot to do that, at leastif you seek any kind of history angle on the subject.) Less well-known: youhave to Teach Menzies’ (H.G. Wells scripted) Things To Come, which was a deliberate,blockbuster response to Lang’s failed blockbuster—which also failed and lostmoney. Things is highly utopian andrationalistic in spirit, which plays very weird onscreen. It’s a study in how not to make Star Wars (for example). The students will dislike it. Then you askthem: list everything this film does wrong, by contemporary Hollywoodstandards. Might it be that Wells was trying to write a philosophy oftechnology? (Alas, an sf screenplay cannot be a philosophy of technology.) Thisis an excellent via negativaexercise. (Holbo)|
|The Leftovers (TV series, 2014-present). (I confess I haven’t read the book ofthat title by Tom Perrotta, who is also one of themakers of the show.) The premise is that all of a sudden, at a point aboutthree years before the story starts, about 2% of the world’s population just…vanished. Poof. It’s kind of like the rapture, except it’s clear that thedeparted people weren’t any better than everyone else, and indeed, there doesn’tseem to be any pattern to who did or did not vanish. It’s maybe a borderlinecase of the SF/Fantasy genre. What I find compellingly philosophical about it,inter alia, is that it is an exploration of what it would be like to like in aworld in which you had evidence that Humean worriesabout induction really were true. What if the universe did just throw us amassive, inexplicable, unprojectable curve ball? Howwould we conduct our lives? (For a much, much darker, weirder, and horrifyingexploration of the unknowable in sci-fi form, I can recommend Jeff Vandermeer’s “Southern Reach” trilogy: Annihilation, Authority, and Acceptance. But I’m not sure Ieven know how to begin glossing it, frankly. So I’m cheating and helping myselfto a parenthetical here.) (Weinberg)|
|Jocelyn Moorhouse, Proof (movie, 1991). A very early film of both Russell Crowe and HugoWeaving (so, fun for that reason alone), in which Weaving plays a curmudgeonlyblind person with real trust issues. Part of his worry about being deceivedrevolves around his lack of access to the visual world, so he has taken totaking photographs, having sighted people tell him what’s in the images,writing that (in braille) on the back, and then checking those descriptionsagainst what other sighted people report. An interesting exploration ofepistemology as well as what epistemic standards are appropriate to whatsituations. (Keeley)|
|Terry Nation etal., Survivors (TV series, 1975-7). A plague wipes out most of humanity and the fewsurvivors try to rebuild society. The series explores political andphilosophical issues, including the relation between the individual and thecollective, the trade-off between freedom and security, and gender politics.Highlights include the episodes “Law and Order”, “Lights of London”, and “Overthe Hills”. (Frankish)|
|Red Dwarf, “Justice” (TV show, 1991). The JusticeField makes it physically impossible for injustice to be committed! (Yap)|
|Alain Resnais, Je t’aime, Je t’aime (movie,1968). A man time travels through the last year of a tragic relationship,re-experiencing events in random order. Uses time travel as a metaphor formemory and the way we construct our identities through narrative. (Frankish)|
|Jac Schaeffer, Timer (movie, 2009). Almost every person is outfitted with a device thatcounts down to the minute the wearer will meet his or her soulmate. (Not ascheesy as it sounds.) Some choose not to have timers, where others rebel andhave relationships with people known to contradict their timers. Fatalism, freewill, utilitarianism. (Bernstein)|
|Tom Scott, “Welcometo Life: The Singularity, Ruined by Lawyers” (YouTube video, 2012). Everyone can have digital immortality, butnot everyone can afford a version unsullied by direct brain advertising. (Mandik)|
|Stephen Spielberg, Minority Report (movie,2002). Covers the topic of pre-punishment: Can we punish people, or hold themmorally responsible, for acts that they (arguably) will commit yet have not yetcommitted? (Based on the Philip K. Dick short story of the same name, 1956. SeeSaul Smilansky, “Determinism and Prepunishment:the Radical Nature of Compatibilism”, 2007.)(Campbell)|
