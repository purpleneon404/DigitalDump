Philosophers’ Science
Fiction / Speculative Fiction Recommendations, Organized by Author / Director

August
15, 2016



Eric
Schwitzgebel



Since
September 2014, I have been gathering recommendations of “philosophically
interesting” science fiction – or “speculative fiction” (SF), more broadly
construed – from professional philosophers.So far, 48 philosophers have contributed (plus one co-contributor).Each contributor has recommended ten works of
speculative fiction and has written a brief “pitch” gesturing toward the
interest of the work.



Below
is the list of recommendations, arranged to highlight the authors and film
directors or TV shows who were most often recommended by the list
contributors.I have divided the list
into (A.) novels, short stories, and other printed media, vs (B.) movies, TV
shows, and other non-printed media.Within each category, works are listed by author or director/show, in
order of how many different contributors recommended that author or director,
and then by chronological order of works for authors and directors/shows with
multiple listed works.For works
recommended more than once, I have included each contributor’s pitch on a
separate line.

Novels
and Short Stories

(and
other printed media)



Recommended by Thirteen

Ursula K. LeGuin

·The Left Hand of Darkness(novel, 1969)

oFirst contact story about someone encountering a society with
radically different manifestations of gender roles, sexuality, and social
norms. Examines issues of gender and sexuality, as well as love and friendship.
(Powell)

oExplores a society where its inhabitants do not have a gender. (De
Cruz)

oThe meaning of gender is explored when a male protagonist comes to a
planet inhabited by humans who change their gender naturally. (Evnine)

·“Nine Lives”(short story, 1969). What is it like to be a clone? And more
specifically, what is it like to have one’s connection to other clones severed
after having been raised together with them? (Kind)

·“The Word for World is Forest”(short
story, 1972, later expanded to a novel, 1976). A logging camp on another world
uses the native species as slave labor. Reflections on colonialism and
responsibility, as well as on social change. What is it to be a person? How do
(and how should) societies change? (J. Kaplan)

·“The Ones Who Walk Away fromOmelas”(short
story, 1973)

oThe problem of evil; one aspect of it I particularly like is that it
puts the problem in more human-sized terms, where the readers must ask
themselves whether they would be the sort of person described by the title, or
not. (Weinberg)

oA purportedreductioof utilitarianism. (Blumson)

·The Dispossessed(novel, 1974)

oSurely the reasons for this are well known enough; amazing
exploration of political and social possibilities. (Allais)

oFollows a physicist from an “anarchist” society. Reflections on
political systems, morality, political organizing. Do all great dreams fail? Is
it the nature of all political systems to decay into bureaucracies, or worse?
(J. Kaplan)

oA gripping story investigating a society that has embraced and
internalized a full-blown communalism. Examines issues of privacy and property,
and the individual’s relationship to society. (Powell)

oAnarcho-syndicalism vs capitalism; scarcity and abundance;
co-operation and competition; sclerosis of a revolution. (Oppenheimer)

oAnother critique of contemporary social-political philosophy … sure
to be relevant for some time to come. (Prescott)

·“The Author of the Acacia
Seeds, and Other Extracts from the Journal of the Association ofTherolinguistics” and “The Ones Who Walk AwayFromOmelas”(short stories, 1982 and 1973). The first: always nice when science
fiction remembers that linguistics is a science. The second: a powerful
counterexample, but note only to certain forms of consequentialism. Think of it
as an argument for good social choice theory. (Dever)

·Always Coming Home(novel, 1985). A very nonstandard imagining of a potential human
future, set in Northern California, in which humans have returned to a largely
primitive and peaceful state of existence, turning their backs on consumerism
and, for the most part, technology. A lovely act of anthropological
imagination. (Jollimore)

·Changing Planes(short stories, collected 2003). Airports are not just places for
transportation between spatial locations; they also host people who want to
change dimensions in between changing flights. Traveler stops over in several
other exotic dimensions, including one in which everything unnecessary for
human life has been removed (“TheNnaMmoyLanguage”). Possible worlds with foreign-yet-familiar
features. (Bernstein)



Recommended by Eleven

Ted Chiang

·Stories of Your Life and
Others(short stories, collected 2002, containing all of the pre-2003 selected
stories below)

oMany others have recommended Chiang and this is absolutely, utterly
justified. His stories are far more sophisticated than those of most other sf
authors. He is a ‘new’ author, relatively. But he is up there with the best of
the classic authors, deservedly. I teach eight Chiang stories every semester
and, at most, two by any other author. (Holbo)

oShort stories following through on the consequences of various
ideas. What if arithmetic actually was inconsistent? What if we did live in a
system of celestial spheres? (Yap)

oA collection ofscifishort stories
exploring diverse philosophical themes -- the problem of evil, the relationship
between language and time, the ethics of beauty. Most of the stories offer an
original and highly creative take on the issue at hand. (Sullivan)

oOne story featuresalienswhose language is visual and non-linear instead of
linear and temporal; another features people who disable the part of their
brain that makes beauty judgments about other people. (Schwitzgebel)

·“DivisionByZero”(short story, 1991). One of the few works I’ve seen of mathematical
science fiction (rather than empirical science fiction), impressive treatment
of the possibility that arithmetic is inconsistent. (Powell)

·“Understand”(short story, 1991)

oThorough and convincing
first-person phenomenology of human super intelligence--you’ll feel like you
know what it’s like to get your IQ quadrupled overnight. (Mandik)

oCoupled with “Flowers for
Algernon,” another exploration of intelligence, its limits, and its potential.
(Bein)

·“Hell is the Absence of God”(short story, 2001). Story set in a world where everyone has
concrete evidence of the existence of God and an afterlife, but no better
understanding of why there is suffering. Examines issues in philosophy of
religion, epistemology, the problem of evil and divine hiddenness. (Powell)

·“Story of Your Life” /
“Evolution of Human Science”(short stories, 1998/2000).
These stories are very different, but both raise fascinating questions about
the nature of science, the role of humans in science, and the consequences of
dealing with scientific progress that exceeds the understanding of individual
humans. (Powell)

·“Hell Is the Absence of God,” “Seventy-Two Letters,” and “Story of
Your Life”(short stories, 1998-2001).Each of these is a fully envisioned reality
that offers a new way of seeing our own. They are each mind-blowing in a
distinctive, inventive way. Ted Chiang is a genius. (Daly)

·“Liking What You See: A
Documentary”(short story, 2002)

oIn the same vein as Vonnegut’s 1961 “Harrison Bergeron,” here Chiang
offers us a brilliant semi-story in which a campus community takes seriously a
pervasive but undiscussed bias – lookism. (Nichols)

o“Lookism” is the idea that how somebody looks – that is, how
attractive they are judged to be by society – has an undue influence on the
advantages and disadvantages a person experiences. If we were able to disable
the part of the brain that judges the attractiveness of faces – if we were able
to reversibly induce the brain disorder known as prosopagnosia – should we?
This short story explores that possibility. (Keeley)

oA meditation on beauty, ugliness, and whether it is possible for
them to be invisible. (Bein)

·The
Lifecycle of Software Objects(novel,
2010).Could an AI have moral rights,
even if it’s just software? It is hard to imagine drumming up sympathy for the
characters in your computer games, but this novel succeeds in pushing us to
consider evenbodylesssoftware blips as objects of
moral concern. (Daly)

·“The Truth of Fact, The
Truth of Feeling”(short story, 2013). One of Chiang's most philosophical stories,
which is saying a lot. Examines the unreliability of memory. If I had more room
for a longer list, at least half of Chiang's stories would be on it. (Baker)

Philip K. Dick

·“The Defenders”(short story, 1953). It forms a great counterpoint to “Autofac.” In “Autofac,” the
machines mindlessly consume the planet to create consumer goods. In “The
Defenders,” – spoiler alert – the machines realize that the humans’ mindless
destruction of the planet (through war, this time, rather than production) is
irrational, and instead they just fake massive destruction to placate the
humans. (Wittkower)

·“Autofac”(short story, 1955). A short story about the grey goo problem in
nanotech, which is, um, a pretty interesting thing to find someone writing
about in the ‘50s. Relevant to the difficulty of acting responsibly with regard
to complex systems whose effects are hard to predict, and about the
questionable value of autonomy when you don’t have any particular rational
determination of values that would guide what you would do with that autonomy.
(Wittkower)

·Time out of Joint(novel, 1959). Not his best, nor yet his most disturbed, fantasy,
but a neat demonstration of what it would be like to discover that one’s entire
life and surroundings are fake! (Clark)

·“We Can Remember It for You Wholesale”(short story, 1966).Philosophy of
memory, what does it mean for something to bemyexperience? (Rosen)

·Counter-clock World(novel, 1967). OMG this one is stupid! It’s the
opposite of Martin Amis’Time’s Arrowin terms of depth,
meaning, writing, sophistication and coherence – but fun and philosophical and
right up my alley. In1986 timearrow flips: people
start calling from their graves to be let out, un-smoking stubs to clean their
lungs…and don’t think about eating and excreting. (Callender)

·Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep(novel, 1968; inspired the
Ridley Scott movieBlade Runner;see
below)

oThere’s the moral isolation from others through an
“experience-machine”-like self-programming of emotional states, contrasted with
Mercer as a kind ofLevinasianOther; animal ethics,
especially as connected to consumerism and environmentalism; AI stuff; etc.
Wonderfully complicated, deep, and wacky – all of which will be surprising if
you’ve only heard of it by way ofBlade
Runner. I’ll also go ahead and plug one of my edited volumes,Philip K. Dick and Philosophy(2011), which has chapters on
philosophical issues in a good number of Dick novels and films. (Wittkower)

oI read this for the first time in middle school, never having heard
ofBlade Runner. The
android vs detective plot is great, and of course the book is an excellent
meditation on human nature. But the best part of the story, I think, is the
dark, dystopian society Dick portrays in the background of the novel.
(Sullivan)

·Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep?and “We Can Remember It for You
Wholesale”(novel, 1968; short story 1966).So many Philip K. Dick works to choose
from!(Allais)

·Ubik(novel, 1969). As with many of Dick’s novels, his characters inhabit
a disturbing world where appearances and reality seem to come apart, and out of
multiple potential versions of reality, it’s not clear what is real, if
anything. (Cameron)

·Flow My Tears, the
Policeman Said(novel, 1974).

oIf Dick doesn’t make you paranoid you’re probably not real. Here he
explores celebrity and identity via a drug which snatches the targets ofausersthoughts into a parallel
reality. (Clarke)

oIn a police state, a TV star wakes up to find he is now a nobody.
What is “reality,” and whose reality matters? (J. Kaplan)

·Radio FreeAlbemuth(novel, 1976). Time stopped in
the first century AD, and restarted in 1945. Come up with a theory of time to
make that consistent! (Dever)

·A Scanner Darkly(novel, 1977; also 2006 movie adaptation). An undercover drug
enforcement agent loses touch with reality. Who are we, when we pretend to be
who we are not? To whom do we owe loyalty? (J. Kaplan)

·“Imposter”(short story, 1986). Philip
K. Dick at his best, struggling to understand the self and self-understanding.
(Bein)



Recommended by Eight

Greg Egan

·“Learning to Be Me”(short story, 1990).

oPermutation Cityis great even if it’s
philosophically incoherent, but this is a much tighter piece about
consciousness and identity. (Chalmers)

oThis may be the best short,
fictional introduction to questions of personal identity and consciousness.
There are many great ones, but this is chilling and delightful. (Daly)

·“The Infinite Assassin”(1991). How are we related to our counterparts throughout the
multiverse? (Kind)

·Permutation City /
Diaspora(novels, 1994, 1997). If we could upload our minds into giant
computers, including duplicating ourselves, backing ourselves up, radically
altering our sensory experiences and personalities, what would be the
consequences for personal identity and the meaning of life? (Schwitzgebel)

·Axiomatic(short story collection, 1995).

oEach story in this collection
develops a strikingly original idea. In “The Hundred Light-Year Diary”, a
method for sending messages to the past is invented, and everyone learns future
history as well as past history, and is issued their life-long diary as soon as
they can read. Rather than investigating free will and fatalism, the story
investigates the political role of information. Several stories investigate
computational alteration or replacement of biological brains and their
consequences for moral responsibility and personal survival and identity. Some
are more comedic. (Easwaran)

oThis collection contains many
of my favorite stories ever, including “Hundred Light Year Diary” (bouncing
signals off a time-reversed galaxy gets you answers before you sent
questions…fate, fatalism, free will, time) “Learning to Be Me” (functionalism,
personal identity). I’ve used three of the stories in philosophy courses.
(Callender)

·“Reasons to be Cheerful”(short story, 1997). Egan, in my pantheon of hard SF writers, plays
with the psychology and philosophy of happiness with a protagonist, narrated in
the first person, who of necessity gains the ability to adjust his mental
well-being moment by moment. (Nichols)

·Diaspora(novel, 1997)

oLiving indefinitely long as a godlike digitalposthumanis all well and good, and when you run out of physical universe(s) to explore,
there’s solace to be had in math. (Mandik)

oA story of software-basedposthumans, who
can create their own identities and virtual environments. Explores what life
might be like when completely freed from biology and massively enhanced by
technology. (Frankish)

StanisławLem

·The Star Diaries, “The Twentieth Voyage”(story in a series, 1957, trans. 1976). A fun story
of time travel, fraught with causality problems and problems of self. (Bein)

·Solaris(novel, 1961; English translation 1970; film adaptation AndreiTarkovsky, 1972)

oCommunication with aliens. What, if anything, is real? Politics of
science and exploration. (Oppenheimer)

oAstronauts on a station in a distant part of the galaxy confront a
massive and deeply inscrutable alien being that may or may not be attempting to
communicate with them, and people (or rather, reproductions of people) from
their pasts, who may in fact be the alien’s attempt to communicate.
Unforgettable and genuinely profound. (The 1972 film alters the ending and, to
some degree, the thematic focus, but it is also fabulous and very beautiful in
its own right, a true cinematic masterpiece.) (Jollimore)

oLemexplores
issues related to limitations of knowledge and communication, philosophy of
mind and the structure of radically different minds. (Fokt)

oWhat would it mean to meet a truly alien intelligence? (Prescott)

oSeems wrong not to mention this classic. Great for epistemology and
philosophy of science. (Callender)

·Return from the Stars(novel, 1961; trans. 1980) Can humans live in a utopian society?
What is the value of suffering, danger and risk, and what can happen if they
are removed? (Fokt)

·TheCyberiad(story collection, 1965; trans. 1974) A collection of
philosophically-themed short stories about the adventures of constructor
engineersTrurlandKlapauciustrying toout doone another. (MagUidhir)

·His Master’s Voice(novel, 1968; English translation 1983)

oOne of the best treatment of the untreatable theme of „translation”
in the Davidson/Quine areas. People are asked to understand what an alientextmessageis... (Palma)

oA thoughtful and intelligent imagination of “first contact” girded
by a deep pessimism about the possibilities of transcending the conceptual
boundaries set by one’s species nature. It would be interesting to read this
(and/orRatner’s Starand/orSolaris) in combination
with Davidson’s “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme,” etc. (Jollimore)

·The Futurological
Congress(novel, 1971; trans. 1974)

oOn distinguishing reality from hallucination;scepticismand issues in knowledge acquisition and justification. (Fokt)

oIt’sThe Matrixon drugs (literally) but better
written and utterly hilarious. (MagUidhir)

·Golem XIV(novel, 1981; trans. 1985). A story from the point of view of an AI
which achieves consciousness, raises issues in philosophy of mind, and
questions human ethics. (Fokt)

·Wizjalokalna(Local Vision)(novel, 1982 – Polish, not translated) Raises moral issues related
to artificial intelligences and immortality. (Fokt)

·Fiasco(novel,
1986; trans. 1987). Another novel exploring the linguistic and cognitive
limitations on understanding and communicating with truly different, alien life
forms. (Fokt)



Recommended by Seven

Isaac Asimov

·“Evidence”(1946). Probes the plausibility of the Turing Test. (Kind)

·I, Robot(short stories, collected 1950)

oClassic short stories in this book, having to do with the
relationship between humans and non-human intelligences. It’s not as utopian
about technology as a lot of Asimov’s other work, but despite several incidents
of robots behaving badly, it’s not all Skynet and doom either. (Yap)

oMost of Asimov’s robot’s stories are situated at the beginning of
positronic robotics and space exploration. Robots are programmed to follow the
Three Laws of Robotics. The filmI, Robotis also excellent. (Schneider)

·“Breeds There a Man?”(short story,
1951).BeforeThe Matrixand NickBostrom, golden age
SF writers had more rough-and-ready ways to explore the idea that our whole
reality is a vast experiment performed upon us by near-omnipotent beings.
(Silcox)

·The End of Eternity(novel, 1955).Most
philosophers like “consistent” time travel with a single timeline, butilove the complex structure here with time police hanging
out inmetatime. (Chalmers)

·The Gods Themselves(novel, 1972).What is
personal identity? (E. Kaplan)

·The Gods ThemselvesandThe End of
Eternity(novels,
1972 and 1955).By far his most
interesting and imaginative work I think. Though myfavouriteisThe Gods Themselves, for
philosophical interestThe End of
Eternityis great as it’s about time travel. (Allais)



Recommended by Six

Margaret Atwood

·A Handmaid’s Tale(novel, 1985)

oHow does the role and treatment of women in our society affect
society? What problems are there with persons of either gender being limited to
reproductive purposes? (Roy-Faderman)

oIn a near future - and a very close possible world - a theocratic
dictatorship has emerged in which women are severely repressed and must
struggle to gain agency and community. (Cameron)

oEthical issues of a world where fertility is declining, feminist
critique of the value of women in society. (Rosen)

·Oryx and Crake(novel, 2003)

oBrilliant genetic engineer Glenn (“Crake”) is disgusted with human
beings, their violence, and their environmental destructiveness. So he destroys
the human race, and replaces it with a new species, the “Crakers”,
which he has designed as a superior replacement. The story is told by the last
surviving human, who was Crake’s best friend before the apocalypse. (Briggs)

oA challenging vision of another all-too-possible future. (Prescott)

·Oryx and Craketrilogy(novels, 2003-2013). Also post
climate collapse, many ideas about current social and technological trends
taken to extremes. (Allais)

Octavia Butler

·“Bloodchild”(short story, 1984)

oExplores the nature of gender roles via a story about an alien race
who need humans for procreative purposes. (Kind)

oMen are forced to bear the progeny of aliens in a gory and
powerfully emotional analogy of motherhood, portrayed as a paradoxically
enjoyable form of abuse. (Clarke)

oSome questions raised by this short story are: How would it feel to
be a farm animal? What exactly is sexual consent? Is the survival of our
species worth any price? (Daly)

·Parable of the Sower(novel, 1993). Gender roles, and the significance of empathy in
discharging our responsibilities for each other. (Evnine)

·Parable of the SowerandParable of the Talents(novels 1993 and 1998).

oInteresting ideas
about post climate collapse, societal collapse and about religion.(Allais)

oDuring a
chillingly realistic slide into dystopia paired with meditations on race,
gender, empathy, and nationalism, a quasi-religion,Earthseed,
is founded by the main character and later questioned by her daughter.
 Should we makespace travel
a long term organizing goal rather than war, economic gain, or political
domination? (Mills)

Edwin Abbott

·Flatland(novel, 1884)

oConceptualization and visualization;imaginability,
conceivability, and possibility; social class and gender structure.
(Oppenheimer)

oA classic work written from the point of view of 2-dimensional
beings in a 2-D world (the “author” of the book is “A Square”) upon their
interaction with the 3rd dimension. Originally, it was renowned for its satire
of hierarchical (Victorian) society, but after Einstein, how it handles the
idea of there being more dimensions than those with which one is familiar
became an important element of how it is read. (Keeley)

oA novel set in spaces of
different dimensions. (Blumson)

oThe original mind-bender.
(Prescott)

oDescription of life in a 2
dimensional world, social critique of the arbitrariness of social standing and
the class system, references Plato’s cave allegory. (Rosen)

Robert A.
Heinlein

·“Jerry Was a Man”(short story, 1947). Ponders the issue of human rights for nonhuman
animals and what it means for someone to be human, with the protagonist, a
genetically-modified chimpanzee. (De Cruz)

·“–All You Zombies–”(short
story, 1959)

oClassic sci-fi story that involves an especially interesting paradox
of time travel. (Campbell)

oIn a world where timetravellersare
responsible for going back to ensure that history happens as it did, a
potential recruit is forced to grapple with the problem of other minds.
(Cameron)

oA looping and incestuous time-travel story. (Blumson)

·The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress(novel, 1966). Heinlein’s lunar society exhibits his libertarian
ideas, as well as the view that there’s no such thing as a free lunch
(expressed in the awkward acronym TANSTAAFL) (De Cruz)

·Job: A Comedy of Justice(novel, 1984). C.S. Lewis meets David Lewis. A literalist
interpretation of the Book of Job playing out across multiple actualized
possible worlds. (DeSmedt)

Kazuo Ishiguro

·Never Let Me Go(novel, 2005)

oHow important is how we’re made to our personhood? What guidelines
should there be to using reproductive technologies? What should the limits of
these uses be, if any? (Roy-Faderman)

oChronicles the plight of cloned humans (who do not know they are
clones) raised for the sole purpose of donating their organs to “ordinary”
humans. Sensitive, beautiful, and far-reaching. (Jollimore)

oA contemporary bioethical cautionary tale. (Prescott)

oThe narrative perspective of
the novel is one of its chief strengths. We discover the plot along with the
narrator, so we spend much of the book wondering what’s going on. A key
question raised: Do human clones deserve the same rights as other humans? The
novel strongly suggests that they do. (Daly)

o**spoiler warning**Althoughthe lives
of the protagonists are at the forefront, the story raises ethical issues regarding
cloning for organ donation and the status of clones. What is a person? (Rosen)

ChinaMiéville

·Embassytown(novel, 2011)

oPhilosophy of language! semiotics! impossibility offalsehood! simile vs metaphor!
(Oppenheimer)

oA member of a very small set of sci-fi books where the relevant
science is linguistics. It centrally concerns the challenge of communicating
with an alien race whose language, among other challenging properties, seems to
be one in which one cannot knowingly express a falsehood. (Having learned about
lying from the humans, the aliens have a kind of Olympic competition to see who
can come as close to lying as possible.) (Weinberg)

oAn alien society that cannot speak falsely first learns from humans
how to make similes, and ultimately learns how to lie, changing them
irrevocably. (Cameron)

oA novel about people trying to interact with an alien race who think
and communicate in a fundamentally different manner than us. A more
sophisticated take on this concept than the TNG episodeDarmok,
and with considerably more interest for philosophers of language. (Powell)

·EmbassytownandThe City &
The City(novels, 2011 and 2009). The first is a fun, if a bit clunky, bit of
exploratory philosophy of language. The second is a particularly adventurous
instance of exploratory metaphysics. (Dever)

Neal Stephenson

·Diamond Age: Or, A Young
Lady’s Illustrated Primer(novel, 1995). A cyberpunk
novel set in a post-scarcity (sort of) world in which any material can be
constructed by nanotechnology “compilers” out of “the Feed”; a supply pipe of
energy and basic elements. A wealthy engineer creates an AI “primer” book that
will provide the best possible education for his daughter, by telling her
stories that teach her about life and help instill whatever skills she will
need (the book is a combination of AI adaptive scriptwriter that learns what
its person needs, and a remote human actor who gives the script real human
voice and emotion). The primer falls into the hands of Nell, a slum dweller.
Explores the role of education, the economics and class structure of a
post-scarcity Earth, the power of those who control the Feed, and artificial
intelligence and virtual reality. (Cash)

·The Baroque Cycle(novels, 2003-2004). Set as
historical novels and developed around the core of interactions between Newton
and Leibniz, explores the origins of modern systems of science and finance in
counterpoint with alchemical memes. (Horst)

·Anathem(novel, 2008)

oAcademics cut themselves off from causal contact with the world in
order to develop theoretical knowledge independent of social and political
fads. Trans-world communication plays an important role. (Easwaran)

oAt the risk of a major spoiler, this book explores ideas of the
quantum multiverse, with the added bonus that some characters are stand-ins for
the views of people like Husserl, Gödel, and Bohr. (Horst)

oIn this advanced-tech world,Arbre, “avout” academics are cloistered from “saecuar”
society, living simple lives in monastic institutions (“concents”)
doing science, philosophy, and studying -- over thousands of years -- the way
the civilizations outside their walls rise and fall. Many of the academics have
views paralleling Earth philosophers and scientists. A recurring debate between
advocates of platonic realism and mathematical formalism plays a role in
solving a mystery/problem/potential threat of world-changing scale and
significance. (Geek fun: identify the Earth philosopher/scientist whose views
are paralleled.) (Cash)

oA sci-fi adventure book
starring a philosopher-monk-hero, where major plot twists involve themanyworldsinterpretation of QM, and debates over Platonism
in metaphysics. No, really. (Weinberg)

oDiscusses many philosophical
topics including parallel worlds discussion of metaphysics. Describes a world
in which modern philosophy is highly valued. (Rosen)

Kurt Vonnegut

·Player Piano(novel, 1952). A satire of industrial and cultural automation in the
near future, where technology has rendered most humans superfluous. Still one
of the most intelligent deep critiques of the dangers of technology to be found
in fiction. (Jollimore)

·The Sirens of Titan(novel, 1959).

oA starkly beautiful spiral through loneliness, omniscience and the
meaning of life. (Clarke)

oQuestions the meaning of life- or lack thereof and free will. A
character who is swept up by fate suffers, loves, finds happiness, dies. Social
critique and the pointlessness of war. (Rosen)

·“Welcome to the Monkey
House”(short story, 1968). What are reasonable responses to a population
issue? In what situation, if any, is assisted suicide ethically allowable? What
are the consequences of different attitudes towards sex and sexuality? (Roy-Faderman)

·Slaughterhouse Five(novel, 1969). Vonnegut at his best, festooned with problems of
ethics, causality, and free will vs. determinism. (Bein)

·Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy(five book “trilogy” 1979-92; also
1978-80 radio play, 2005 movie, 1984 video game, a comic book, and a set of
towels)

oThis book and the series still delivers Mona Lisa-like smiles (and
laughs) to thinking readers from the moment Arthur’s first grabs a towel – and
a pint – to the moment whenZaphodasks to “meet the
meat” at the Restaurant. (Nichols)

oThe babel
fish disproves god; the cow wants to be eaten; the total perspective vortex;
time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so; and 42. (Chalmers)

oSF comedy classic; tells the story of a “wholly remarkable book”
through the story of Arthur Dent, an Earthling whose planet is destroyed to
make room for a hyperspace bypass and his friend Ford Prefect who turns out to
be from a planet near Betelgeuse, and who writes for the book. (Ironically the
story of Arthur Dent is often punctuated by excerpts from the book.) The book’s
entire entry on the planet Earth reads “Mostly harmless”. Explores many
philosophical ideas. See especially the Total Perspective Vortex, a proof of
God’s existence (which thus proves that He cannot exist), the End of the
Universe, an ethical meat that wants to be eaten, a virtual reality universe,
and a supercomputer programmed to compute the Answer to the Ultimate Question
of Life, the Universe, and Everything (philosophers threaten to strike if the
machine does their job, until the machine proposes a better idea). Also reveals
the true origin of the Earth and of Humanity. (Cash)

oDiscussion of the meaning of life (or lack thereof), critique of how
indigenous or rural populations are treated. (Rosen)

·“Crash Space”(short story, 2015). In the future, rich people can directly control
their emotional responses to the world, of course. Black market products can
hack past the safety controls, of course. (Pairs nicely with Egan’s “Reasons to

Jorge Luis
Borges

·Labyrinths(esp. “Tlön,Uqbar,
andOrbisTertius”, “The
Library of Babel”, and “The Circular Ruins”, short stories, mostly 1940-1949).
Every story is philosophically weird and interesting in multiple ways, with
repeating themes of infinitude, temporality, repetition, and metaphysical
idealism. (Schwitzgebel)

·“Tlon,Uqbar,OrbisTertius”(short story, 1941). This short story is a beautiful illustration of
a particularly strange form of anti-realism. (Blumson)

·“On Rigor in Science”(short story, 1946). I want to use this one-paragraph short story in
a paper on idealization. It brings up an empire in which map-making has
“advanced” such that the only acceptable map of the empire is one of the exact
same scale as the empire itself. (Yap)

·“The Immortal”(1947). An intriguing exploration of why immortality may not be
quite what we’d bargained for; pairs well with Bernard Williams’ “TheMakropulosCase: Reflections on the Tedium of Immortality.”

oTime travelers on safari change the past by being lazy and straying
off the path. A consistent time travel story. Hilarious. (Schneider)

·Fahrenheit 451(novel, 1953). State-administered book burning,anaesthetisedlife, an eloquent hymn to the power of the written idea. (Clarke)

·Dandelion Wine(a collection of connected short stories, 1957). Possibly the most
charming existential novel you will find. Douglas Spaulding, 12 years old,
living in Green Town Illinois in 1927, realizes that he is alive. But with that
comes the realization that one day he also will die. A rumination about what it
means to really live, love, and be happy. It’s not obviously SF, but by an SF
author, and includes a time machine, an attempt to build a virtual reality
“happiness machine” (c.f.Nozick’s“experience
machine”), a tragic love story about a reincarnated lover, a ready-to-die
great-grandma’s thoughts on immortality, a 9 year old’s inspiring thoughts on
happy endings, a serial killer horror story and the need for scary stories that
add danger to life, a mechanical gypsy fortune-teller who cries for help, and
bottling all the joys of a summer day into a bottle of dandelion wine. (Cash)

·Kiln People(novel, 2002)

oI also foundBrin’suplift trilogy a lot
of fun but this one is more philosophical in ideas about personal identity.
(Allais)

oThere is technology for creating clones that can live for a day, and
which have most or all of the capacities of the individual. The novel
investigates consequences for economics, privacy, politics, and health, in the
midst of a noir set in future Los Angeles. (Easwaran)

oAnother hard-sf ‘Killer B’ (like Bear—see
also:Benford) from the 80’s who didn’t make the
Wesleyan cut.Brinis not so strong in the short
story department (so his exclusion from a short story collection is
pardonable.)Kiln Peopleis a novel
from 2002, but I rate it philosophically higher than his better-known Uplift
books.Kilncame in second for, like,everyprize. Itcoulda’
been a contender for classic novel status!If you are teaching personal identity stuff and you want DerekParfit’sReason and
Persons, but a murder mystery, this is for you.Brinis on my list twice, not because he’s so great as all that, just because if I
assign essays or criticism from fiction writers, I like to sample their actual
fiction as well. And I assignBrin’scriticism. See
the next entry. This semester I’m planning to recommend (not require)Kiln. (Holbo)

oWhat if you could temporarily put your
consciousness into a disposable copy of yourself, which could then run various
errands for you, and whose consciousness would be re-absorbed by yours after 24
hours? The copies are self-destructing: if they don’t re-absorb by 24 hours,
then they disintegrate, so in general, the copies strongly identifyasthe person they are copies of,
expecting to live on via the re-absorption. But then again... what if you were
such a copy, and you realized that you are now in a circumstance where you
won’t ever get to rejoin the original? Really interesting exploration of
fusion/fission and personal identity; it’s written in what one might call the
first-person-singular-plural. (Weinberg)

P. D. James

·Children of Men(novel, 1992; AlfonsoCuarónmovie, 2006)

oCenters on themes that have recently been explored by SamSchefflerabout the role of the ongoing existence of humanity
in giving meaning to the life of an individual. (Easwaran)

oSocial criticism and theological reflection focusing on the results
of mass infertility. (De Cruz)

oWhat would life on Earth be like if human beings suddenly lost the
ability to have children? This novel is a compelling and disturbing imagining
of the extinction of the human race that feels, to me, much more vivid and real
than nearly any other apocalyptic work of fiction I can think of. (SamuelSchefflercites the novel in his book,Death and the Afterlife;
reading the two in conjunction would be productive.) The 2006 film, directed by
AlfonsoCuarón, is also excellent. (Jollimore)

oWhile there are a number of plot differences between the film and
the book, both do an excellent job of investigating reactions to an existential
threat to humanity arising from total infertility. (Powell)

CharlesStross

·Accelerando(novel, 2005)

oHow much computer enhancement and dissociation of the self is
compatible with remaining human? what are the differences between a software
algorithm, a legal system, an organism, and a religion, and can all of them
potentially be conscious? (Easwaran)

oNothing else that I’ve read comes as close to this in depicting what
living through the technological singularity would be like; “mind-bending
future shock” is an insufficiently hyperbolic superlative. (Mandik)

oUploaded minds; post-humanism; the singularity. What is a person,

oLike most singularity fiction, the depiction of superintelligence is
disappointing, but theexospecsget the extended mind

evil? What is the role of universalizability in ethics? (E. Kaplan)

·The Book of the New Sun(four novels and a coda, 1980-1987)

oA haunting work about the experience of finitude. (Evnine)

oModern masterpiece of literature, science-fiction or otherwise.
Difficult and at times seems impenetrably dense but, like much of Wolfe’s work,
the rewards for the careful reader are endless. (MagUidhir)

Iain M. Banks

·“The State of the Art”(short story collection, 1989). The Culture (featured in many of
Banks’ SF/Space Opera novels), is a post-scarcity libertarian technological utopia,
in which AI minds take care of just about all the heavy thinking and planning,
and humanoid inhabitants can do and be whatever they want. The theme through
many of these novels is how messed up people can still be in such a utopia. A
Culture ship and its human crew discover Earth in 1977, at the height of the
Cold War and on the brink of nucleararmageddon. Our
narrator argues for contact. Another wants to defect to Earth (inconceivably to
many of his colleagues). Another argues that the whole insane planet should be
destroyed with a micro-black hole. The limits of utopia, the beauty of flawed
humanity, the role of scarcity and risk and fragility in human life, and the
possibility that important aspects of life might be lost when one can have and
do whatever one likes, for as long as one likes. (Cash)

·Surface Detail(novel, 2010)

oIf we plot ideas-per-page on the x-axis and quality of writing on
the y, Banks’ novels exist in an upper-right-corner world of their own, and
this probing novel about punishment, religion and the state is no exception.
(Nichols)

oOnce any civilization develops realistic artificial realities, in
which people can upload themselves and live, religious fanatics inevitably use
this tech to make sure that there really is a Hell, in which “deserving” people
can now be subjected to unending torture and torment. A war is being fought in
a series of different virtual realities, to determine whether these Hells
should exist. The anti-hell side (including the above mentioned Culture) is losing.
Should the virtual war be brought into the real world, if it means saving
millions of intelligent beings from eternal torment? (Cash)

·Cosmicomics(short story collection, 1965; trans. 1968). Old manQfwfqrecounts the reader with stories of his youth, when

Frank Herbert

·Dune(novel, 1965)

oFamed meditation on individual exceptionality, politics, and

see the future, suggests at the perils of AI. (Rosen)

·Frank Herbert and Bill
Ransom,The Jesus Incident(novel, 1979). The real story of the real Pandora (as opposed to
James Cameron’s imperialistic pastiche), pitting organic and technological
intelligences at multiple levels. (Bakker)

·God Emperor of Dune(novel,
1981). The most philosophical of a philosophical series.  Aside from
Herbert’s usual ruminations on politics, ecology, and what it means to be human
when some are more human than human, it asks: What would you do with the whole
human race? (Mills)

Fred Hoyle

·The Black Cloud(novel, 1957).

oBegins as an impending-disaster-for-earth story, but introduces a
twist: the giant cloud approaching earth is conscious and is surprised to find
other conscious beings in the universe. Consciousness, multiplerealizability, the works. (Bernstein)

oThe late British astronomer’s
novel starts out looking like a novel about a disaster from deep space, but
takes a turn to explore the prospects of communication with an alien
intelligence very different from ourselves. (Horst)

oI’m excited to see others

George R. R.
Martin

·“With Morning ComesMistfall” (short story, 1973).
A scientific expedition comes to debunk to a local myth. Is there a value in
leaving things unexplored? Should we want science to answer even the all the
questions it can answer? Is there any value in remaining willfully ignorant of
what we could easily learn? (J. Kaplan)

·A Song of Ice and Fire(series of novels, 1996-present;Game
of Thrones,HBO drama 2011-present)

oThe main plot content is not
especially philosophical, but this series raises questions of the extent to
which families rather than individuals are the units of action, in a world that
is more economically and historically developed than most fantasy. (Easwaran)

oAn extended meditation on the
nature of power, set in a mediaeval/magical world. Many aspects of political
philosophy are explored here. Political power, military power, religious
influence, wealth, the institutions of nobility and inheritance, the
irrelevance of “fairness”, the “soft” power of women in a patriarchy, the
limitations of “honorable” conduct in a dishonorable world, the perceived importance
(or not) of familial love and bonds, the military advantages of powerful
weapons (dragons), the plight of the common people when “powerful” people go to
war for more power, the horrors of war, what successful leadership requires,
the distraction of human power-games in the face of a largely-ignored
world-threatening common problem.... (Cash)

Cormac McCarthy

·The Road(novel, 2006)

oDeeply moving story about the lengths a father will go to in order
to preserve a sense of hope in his young son, even as the world around them

Larry Niven

·Ringworldand sequels(novels, starting 1970). An
enormous engineered world encircling a distant star provides a context for
exploration of the variability of the human phenotype and contrasts with two
alien species and a third that turns out to not be as alien as we first imagine.
(Horst)

·A Hole in Space(short stories, collected 1974). The master of ‘soft’ (sociological)scifi, Niven was visionary at thinking through the
human consequences of new technologies. Teleportation here acts as social
lighter fluid, enabling the formation of dangerously volatile ‘flash mobs’, as
well as adding new depths a to murder mystery challenge. (Clarke)

·Larry Niven and JerryPournelle,The
MoteInGod’s Eye(novel,
1974). First contact, not so much between species, as between technical intelligences
(corresponding to the angels and devils of our own scientific natures).
(Bakker)

George Orwell
(Eric A. Blair)

·1984(novel, 1949)

oAn excellentscifi/fantasy comparison on
what control is in education and social relationships. (Palma)

oA vivid polemic on the human cost of political authoritarianism,
whose original ideas and phrases – Big Brother, Room 101 – are now firmly in
the mainstream. (Clarke)

oIn a grimy Stalinist state,
thought is controlled, history rewritten, and the minds of nonconformists ruthlessly
reshaped. Themes include collectivism, power, censorship, propaganda, and the
relation between language and thought. (Frankish)

Mary Shelley

·Frankenstein(novel, 1818)

·It seems almost unnecessary to
list this work, which is such a widely read classic. Shelley’s tale of the
“modern Prometheus” does an exceptional job of raising questions about the
nature of humanity and the ethics of creating life. (Powell)

·So standard you might fail to
try it. Try it! I’m a historicist, so I bounce off Brian Aldiss’ well-known
Frankenstein-is-first critical line. A nice teaching trick: ask the kids to
tell the story of Frankenstein before they read the novel for the first time.
So what’s the philosophical difference between what we know is going to be
there, and what actually turns out to be there? Also, this is maybe the single
most often adapted work of sf, in a broad sense. (So many artificial beings
constructed, so unwisely, since Shelley’s day.) (Holbo)

·The original bioethical
cautionary tale. (Prescott)

Bruce Sterling

·“Swarm”(short story, 1982). What is the function/advantage of intelligence?
This story involves an encounter between a group of scientists and a
(apparently) non-intelligent, superorganism species that resemble earthly
social insects. Sterling’s piece looks at other forms that intelligent life
might take. (Keeley)

·“The Beautiful and the Sublime”(short
story, 1987).In this story’s version of
the future, scientific inquiry is the exclusive province of genius AIs. The
protagonist is a harmless, but hyperbolic fop who spends all his spare time
breathlessly theorizing about aesthetics, and can’t quite manage to understand
why some of his friends might find such a life unsatisfying. A very subtle and
cheerfully malevolent piece of cultural criticism. (Silcox)

·SchismatrixPlus(novel, 1996) Deeply weird
political and economic turmoil in a solar system infested by post human
factions (genetically engineered vs cyborgs) and, eventually, extraterrestrial
investors. (Mandik)

·Holy Fire(novel, 1997).An ingeniously
constructed novel about youth, aging, and the ambiguous benefits of socialized
medicine. The near-future that Sterling envisages is rich with interesting
personalities and technologies, and his protagonist, who starts the story about
half a century older than she is by the end of it, is a memorable character.
(Silcox)

James Tiptree
Jr., (Alice Bradley Sheldon)

·“Love is the Plan the Plan
is Death”(short story, 1973). A sentient arthropod contemplates free will,
but everything he wills happens to match the typical life cycle of his species.
(Briggs)

·anything fromHer Smoke Rose
Up Forever(besides “And I Awoke and Found Me Here OnTheCold Hill’s Side”)(short stories, 1969-1980).Alice
Sheldon, a.k.a. James Tiptree, Jr. is the best female sf author who isn’t named
Ursula. Or maybe she’s just the best. But the Wesleyan editors, in their
wisdom, include what I regard as one of her most ‘meh’ stories. No accounting
for taste, but I would recommend herotherstories, and every sf and philosophy class should include one from Tiptree.
(Also, I supposeHer Smoke Rose Up
Forevergoes well, in a titular sense, with Bear’sThe WindFromA Burning Woman. Not that I
recommend beingpyromaniacalabout it. But maybe you
have a St. Joan thing?) (Holbo)

·“A Momentary Taste of Being”(short story, 1975) -- biology and the purpose of life. (E. Kaplan)

VernorVinge

·A Fire Upon the Deep(novel, 1992). A story involving a variety of kinds of minds,
including transcendent minds, human minds infused by transcendent minds, and
group minds. (Evnine)

·A Fire upon the Deep /
Children of the Sky(novels 1992 and 2011).
Features small packs of doglike creatures who communicate constantly through
high-frequency sound; only together do they have sophisticated intelligence.
(Schwitzgebel)

·Trilogy starting withA Fire Upon the Deep(novels, 1992-2011).Amazingly fun
different forms of consciousness, including collective consciousness. (Allais)

RogerZelazny

·“For a Breath I Tarry”(short
story, 1966). A beautiful depiction of a machine’s quest to understand what it
is like to be human. (See also Isaac Asimov’s novella,Bicentennial Manand Kurt Vonnegut’s “EPICAC”) (Kind)

·Lord of Light(novel, 1967)

oFeatures naturalistic versions of Hindu gods and reincarnation. Can
the status quo be challenged by introducing Buddhism? (De Cruz)

oIn the far future humans use technology to
become gods and goddesses from the Hindu pantheon, until a Buddhist challenger
arrives.  Not entirely accurate, nor easy to understand, but always fun.

J. G. Ballard

·“The Thousand Dreams ofStellavista”(short story, 1962). A man drives his wife to kill him, also
inadvertently (but foreseeably) programming his “psychotropic” house to later
attempt to kill its new owners. Each chapter of theVermillion Sandscollection (which this is from) uses
science fiction to explore a different art form – this is the chapter on

Greg Bear

·The WindFromA Burning Woman(short stories, 1978-1983).Bear
is first and foremost a novelist, and many of his novels are philosophically
fantastic and would be eminently teachable. But in the classroom there is a
limit on the number of novels you can assign. Short stories are the way to go.
I pickWind, rather than, say,Tangents, because it contains “Petra”,
about the day the laws of nature change. Verygrue.
But medieval, if that’s your cup of after time-t and/or you want to get Goodman
and the Good God of Augustine out of the way at the same time. I list Bear to
compensate for his unjust omission from the Wesleyan. I think their picks from
the 1980’sarenon-representative. (I have not
actually assigned Bear in my own class but am planning to do “Petra” this
coming semester.)Bear deserves to be
higher on the list of recommended authors than he currently stands. (Holbo)

GeorgeEffinger

·What Entropy Means to Me(novel, 1972).Reflective
consumers of genre literature often have an excessive respect for murky,
vaguely Jungian ideas about archetypes, mythemes, andur-narratives.
This novel is a funny and merciless send-up of the whole daft worldview that
also ends up being quite touching. (Silcox)

·When Gravity Fails(novel, 1986). What would it be like to be able to load new
characters or new talents via computer add-ons, set in a future dominated by
Muslim (and mostly criminal) culture. There were two sequels, continuing the
story, but without any final resolution. (Clark)

·Murder Mysteries(short story, 1992; graphic novel, 2002). As Heaven enters into late
stages of planning for the Creation, an angel is wakened to serve his purpose
as Heaven’s detective, to investigate the very first murder ever. It plays with

·The Forever War(novel, 1974)

oTwo species are sucked into an
interstellar war against unknowable enemies with an incomprehensible psyche.
Human veterans have to adapt to cultures with norms that are ever more remote
from the society they originate from. (DeSmedt)

·RiddleyWalker(novel, 1980)

sense of their distant past (us), told in an invented dialect that makes it
equally a problem for us to make sense of them. (Evnine)

oLike thatStar Trekepisode “Darmok”, except, you know, good. Also, best
post-apocalyptic novel ever by a significant author of children’s literature. (Dever)

Doris Lessing

·The Marriages Between
Zones Three, Four and Five(novel, 1980; Philip Glass
opera, 1997). Gender: are gender characteristics inherent?Gender essentialism; communication among
genders. (Oppenheimer)

·The Fifth Child(novel, 1988). How do we deal with the intolerable when we have an
obligation to care for it? (Evnine)

CixinLiu

·The Three Body Problem(novel 2008, trans. 2014).  Begins during
the Chinese Cultural Revolution and follows a First Contact story and a video
game that featuresMoziand Leibniz and introduces a
world where the laws of nature aren’t uniform. (Mills)

·The Dark Forest(novel 2008, trans. 2015). This is the second installment afterThe Three Body Problem.
Good for game theory? After learning what the title refers to (a theory),
you’ll never be in favor of the SETI program. (Callender)

·Watchmen(graphic novel, 1986-87)

·An otherwise realistic world
contains an almost omnipotent superhero. His perception of time raises
questions about free will andevitability, and his
presence raises difficult moral and political questions. (Cameron)

·Free will vs. determinism, good
intentions vs. good consequences, heroes vs. antiheroes;Watchmenis
always the highlight of the semester whenever I assign it. (Bein)

Mike Resnick

·“Kirinyaga”(short story, 1988). The best and most fêted story – one dealing a
deft touch to issues of race and gender, justice and moral relativism – from an
author who needs to hire someone to carry around his treasure trove of
awards.(Nichols)

·Seven Views of Olduvai
Gorge(novel, 1994) Novella that uses stories from a single geographic
location across time to weave together a portrait of humanity (and the rise and
fall thereof) as an essentially ruthless and thoroughly evil blight upon the
universe. (MagUidhir)

Joanna Russ

·The Female Man(novel, 1975)

·A woman is introduced to her
counterparts from three different possible worlds, in which feminism has taken
three different historical courses. (Briggs)

·Four women living in different
times and places cross over to each other’s worlds and are startled by gender
roles and assumptions of worlds that at not their own. Feminist philosophy,
philosophy of gender. (Bernstein)

MaryDoriaRussell

·The Sparrow(novel, 1996)

·Jesuits in space! The main
theme of the book concerns the protagonist’s crisis of faith, but I much
preferred the supporting characters, each of whom had a fascinating backstory
which revealed quite a bit about the Earth culture in the novel. (Sullivan)

·Irrefutable proof of an alien
civilization is discovered, and we could get there in just a few years’ travel
time. While the UN is deliberating about what to do, the Jesuits recognize a
message from God in the circumstances of the discovery, and so organize a
secret Mission to this world. But the mission ends in horrific disaster. A
Jesuit priest and linguist is the sole survivor, rescued 40 years later, now
broken, bitter, disillusioned, and reluctant to discuss the mission. Alternating
chapters set at the beginning and end of the mission explore how this disaster
happened. Themes of interspecies interpretation (and misinterpretation), what
the existence of an alien civilization means for religion (is our God also
their God?), interpretation of God’s will (if He so obviously wanted us to go
there, how could He let it become such a disaster)? (Cash)

Robert J.
Sawyer

·Hominids(novel,
2002; alsoHumansandHybrids, 2003).Hominidsis the first book in theNeanderthalParallaxtrilogy, in which a doorway to a
parallel universe opens up in Sudbury, Ontario. Yes, Sudbury. In the parallel
universe, Neanderthals became dominant rather than us. It’s interesting
thinking through the differences in the family culture of each group, since
Neanderthals in the other universe have two partners, one male and one female.
(Yap)

·Mindscan(novel, 2005). A fellow with an inoperable brain tumor attempts to
upload his brain onto a computer and learns the hard way that uploading is no
means of survival. Sawyer astutely depicts the metaphysical, legal and ethical
challenges that arise. It is fun to assign this book with philosophical work on
personal identity, such asParfiton teleportation.
(Schneider)

Dan Simmons

·Phases of Gravity(novel, 1989). The story follows an Apollo astronaut who walked on
the moon, as he moves through a world that no longer seems to be moving
forward. Where do we find meaning in our lives? How do we reconcile ourselves
to the world we find ourselves in? (J. Kaplan)

·Hyperion(novel, 1989). The best science fiction novel I’ve ever read, a
treasure of the genre. It isn’t philosophical throughout, but the chapter
titled “The Scholar’s Tale” contains a lot of interesting philosophy of
religion. (Baker)

OlafStapledon

·Star Maker(novel, 1937). What is the purpose of life and history? (E. Kaplan)

·Sirius(novel, 1944). A dog endowed with human intelligence struggles to
make sense of love, human irrationality, and the meaning of life.
(Schwitzgebel)

Arkadyand BorisStrugatsky

·Roadside Picnic(novel, 1971; various English translations available; also adapted
in AndreiTarkovsky’s1979 film,Stalker). Yet another book
about the difficulties of communicating with alien intelligences. Humans deal
with the incomprehensible after-effects of an alien visitation.(Jollimore)

·Arkadyand BorisStrugatsky,The Time Wanderers(novel, 1985; English translation 1987).Ever since Tolstoy, the greatest Russian writers have shown an almost
supernatural ability to understand and dramatize the tragic sweep of their own
nation’s history. This short novel is a reflection on the limitations and
paradoxes of planned societies, and the myths about human equality that can
both sustain and undermine them. If Soviet censors had been paying any serious
attention to SF when this was published, theStrugatskybrothers would certainly have been sent to Siberia. Small mercies! (Silcox)

Theodore
Sturgeon

·Maturity(short stories, 1947-1958). What is the purpose of life? What is a
well-lived life? (E. Kaplan)

·Venus Plus X(novel, 1960). What is gender? Is gender necessarily a binary? Why
(Roy-Faderman)

Daniel Suarez (LeinadZeraus)

·DaemonandFreedomTM(novels,
2006 and 2010). Originally written as a single work, but eventually published
in two volumes, these two books can be seen as an exploration of the
implications of a number of technologies currently on the horizon (with some
coming to pass even in the few years since they were written). Written in the
form of a cyberpunk thriller, AI, drones, 3D-printing, self-replicating autonomous
machine warfare, video games, & virtual reality are all thrown into the
mix, as an AI begins to organize a conspiracy to control (or at least
significantly change) the world. Many themes in philosophy of technology are at
play. (Keeley)

·Influx(novel, 2014). Justly compared to Crichton, Suarez’s page-turning
plotting does not come at the expense of intelligent protagonists and
antagonists, thank God; but make no mistake, this exciting but thoughtful book
is much more than aisle-seat fodder. (Nichols)

Jack Vance

·The Dying Earth(novel, 1950) Set millions of years in the future against the
backdrop of a dying sun where mathematics has become magic and Earth a thing of
terrible beauty. (MagUidhir)

·The Languages ofPao(novel, 1957): sketches a
universe in which a strong version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is true. (DeSmedt)

Peter Watts

·Blindsight(novel, 2006)

oAn intelligent spaceship crewed by neurologically enhanced humans
makes first contact with a terrifyingly alien species, while a narrator skilled
in reading body language struggles to make sense of it all. Raises questions
about the nature of intelligence and the function of phenomenal consciousness.
This book is like crack cocaine for philosophers of mind. (Frankish)

oCogscisavvy tale
in which assortedtranshumansand extraterrestrials
get by just fine without phenomenal consciousness...or do they? (Mandik)

H. G. Wells

·“The Remarkable Case of
Davidson’s Eyes”(short story, 1895). The definitive counterexample to immunity to
error through misidentification. (Dever)

·“The Country of the Blind”(short story, 1904). In this short story, Wells describes an
explorer,Nuñez, who accidentally discovers a valley
in the Andes separated off from the rest of the world containing a population
of humans who have all lost their sight several generations earlier. As such,
they no longer believe in the phenomenon of vision. The story followsNuñez’sfrustrating attempts to first rule them (after all,
in the country of the blind…) and then later even to convince them that he has
access to a sense that they do not have. How would one go about convincing a
group of extremely functional blind people, living in an environment that they
have adapted to their needs, of the existence of the visual world? Wells argues
that it would be harder than one might initially imagine. (Keeley)

Connie Willis

·The Doomsday Book(novel, 1992). How does disease affect society and culture,
particularly with respect to our moral and ethical standards? How do we
understand the impact of our small actions on the future, and what effect
should potential impact have on our current behavior? (Roy-Faderman)

·To Say Nothing of the Dog(novel, 1998) A thoroughly enjoyable time-travel romp with a
surprisingly philosophically sophisticated ending. (MagUidhir)

John C. Wright

·The Golden Age(and sequels)(novels, 2002-2003)

oSet in a very far future capitalist utopia, about to be threatened
by a very different form of society. Questions about identity, humanity, social
control are implicit, and there are even clear and fairly compelling arguments,
mostly drawn from Stoic sources, about the rational roots of ethics. (Clark)

oA well-thought-outposthumanlibertarian
utopia. (Also a deeply sexist novel, I'm afraid.) (Baker)

·InnePieśni(Other Songs)(novel, 2003 – Polish, not translated) An alternative history,
starting from Alexander the Great’s times, in which Aristotle's physics is

(novel, 2004 – Polish, not translated) Both novels explore post-humanism, the

minority who know and accept that humanity is transient. (Clark)

The onlineEncyclopedia of
Science Fiction,John Clute et al., eds.(non-fiction
encyclopedia, 1979-present).Weirdly,
students often seemnotto find this
when they are looking for stuff. You really ought to point them to it. It’s not
itself fiction, nor (primarily) philosophical, but it’s scholarly enough. And
it’s huge. Why don’t more people know of it? Why isn’t it higher in the Google
ranks? I don’t know. I really don’t. (Holbo)

TimonsEsaias, “Norbert and the System”(short story, 1993). Imagine an app, dropped into the head of a
Homer Simpson-like character, that uses an algorithm to instruct him – with microsecond
speed – that if he wants her to like him, for example, he ought to tilt his
head a bit more to the left and use the words “I feel” in the next sentence he
utters. Written with wit and humor, this meditation on free will and
compatibilism is more than the sum of its parts and foreshadows theincreasing lack of empathy offacebookingmillenials. (Nichols)

reflection on love and sacrifice. (Evnine)

Bernard leBouvierFontenelle,Entretienssur lapluralitédesmondes[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds](novel/dialogue,

imagination is smaller and not larger than what is known. (Palma)

deep science fictional meditations on the value of diversity in which physiological diversity is paired with

generation,taoistChinese alchemy, andgeocentrismwith real spheres in space. (De Cruz)

Carolyn Ives Gilman,Dark Orbit(novel, 2015).  An expedition to a planet
where the inhabitants are mostly blind.  Interrogateswhether the senses, especially in the modality
of vision, and empirical scientific methodologies are giving us the full

story, 1954). Classic lifeboat ethics problem, but made very personal, not at
all abstract. (Bein)

Fabulous Child’s Story”(short story, 1972). What role
does gender identity play in our lives? What would life be like without it?
(Kind)

RyoHanmura, “Tansu”(short story, 1997). A magicaltansu, or
chest of drawers, motivates people to sit on top of it all night, chanting
mechanically. When asked, people transformed by thetansuunanimously describe thetheactivity as deeply
fulfilling, yet the narrator finds something frightening in the idea of being
transformed. (Briggs)

Nalo Hopkinson,Brown Girl in the Ring(novel, 1998). This book has everything you didn’t know you wanted
in a book: three generations of kickass women, post-apocalyptic Toronto, and
some Afro-Caribbean magic. That’s all I need to tell you, now go read it
immediately. I think it’s one of the best and most underrated works of feminist
speculative fiction out there. (Yap)

Hugh Howey,Wool(short story series, 2011-2013). Not great writing, but fun, fast and original. Plato in the Cave
themes, trolley problem dilemmas. (Callender)

Henry James, “The
Jolly Corner”(short story, 1908). Revisiting his childhood home, a middle-aged
man confronts his monstrous alter ego and achieves a sort of redemption. Raises
questions about choice, responsibility, character, and personal identity. (For
a different take on the same theme, see BasilDearden’s1970 film,The Man Who Haunted
Himself, starring Roger Moore.) (Frankish)

Liz Jensen,The Uninvited(novel, 2012). The nature of the adult world, and its relation to

dare you. (Nichols)

GuyGavrielKay,Tigana(novel, 1990). A sorcerous
dictator keeps his political enemies subordinated by making it literally
impossible for them to express their shared sense of cultural identity.
(Cameron)

Johann Kepler, “Somnium”(novel, 1608). An incredible
story by one of the most important scientists in world history, Kepler
(1571-1630) represents a trip to the moon according to extrapolation from his
then-current, accurate, and highly non-standard scientific knowledge. (The
real-life story behind “Somnium” and what it cost
Kepler personally is more gripping.) (Nichols)

John Kessel,
“Stories for Men”(short story, 2002). Fascinating piece about gender. Examines a civilization
in which women are privileged in something like the way our civilization
privileges men. (Baker)

Stephen King,The Stand(novel,
1978). The world has been ravaged by a disastrous plague called Captain Trips.
The novel charts the path of various survivors who must choose sides in an
apocalyptic battle. But the description doesn’t do justice to King’s richly
imagined characters and twisty plot. (Sullivan)

Nancy Kress, “Nano
Comes to Clifford Falls”(short story, 2006). Nano destroys scarcity, work is no longer
necessary, society falls apart. (Wittkower)

SigizmundKrzhizhanovsky, “Quadraturin”(short story, 192-something). There’s a superabundance of science
fiction about weird physics and metaphysics of time, but a disappointing dearth
of the same with space. This is an exception. (Dever)

MadelineL’Engle,A
Wrinkle in Time/A Wind in the Door/A
Swiftly Tilting Planet(novels, 1962-1978). This may
have been my first introduction to science fiction as a child, and while it is
not the most intellectually challenging series about time travel (and
dimensional travel, in the case of the memorable Cherubim that is both singular
and plural), it is perhaps still the most memorable and endearing. (Horst)

Jonathan Lethem,Gun, With
Occasional Music(novel, 1994).Lethem
takes up the Philip K. Dick mantle in about as stylish and sophisticated a way
as anyone ever has. PKD is a giant, of course, and I assume you are teaching
some. (What are you? A fool?) So maybe you want to talk about the literary
legacy of that line?Gun, With Occasional
Music. It’s got anUbik-y,VALIS-y,Scanner Darkly-yparanoidnoir-vibe.
In a weird way it would go great withBrin’sKiln People(see #5). Or his Uplift
novels, come to think of it. (That kangaroo!) A murder mystery that is really
an exploration of personal identity, only in this case the technicalnovumis not
qualitative duplication of selves but deliberate (often pharmaceutical)
self-design. Yet Lethem is stylistically the antipodes ofBrin.
So hereby you get at that no-nonsense hard-sf thing that goes back to Campbell
andGernsback, vs. the literary New Wave that starts
in the 60’s. You can’t teach the history of sf without touching on that, I say.
(Holbo)

Doug Liman,Edge of Tomorrow(movie,
2014). A mysterious brain controls a huge number of robots that occupy Europe.
An American journalist finds himself in the position of being killed a number
of times retaining the memory traces of the killings before his death. On what
free will entails in terms of what (Borges &) H. Frankfurt would call “the
alternatives”. (Palma)

Richard Matheson,I Am Legend(novel, 1954). If you’re the last surviving human in a
vampire-apocalypse, does it make sense to want to survive? And who is the
monster, to be feared, in a new world populated by vampires? (De Cruz)

Will McIntosh,Soft Apocalypse(novel, 2011).An extremely
pessimistic dystopian novel that manages to avoid the usual libertarian
fantasies of noble individuals being persecuted by a demonic state. McIntosh’s
apocalypse is the kind can only be blamed on humanity at large. (Silcox)

StephenieMeyer,Breaking
Dawn(novel, 2008): sketches the perfect postmortem human body as
outlined in the hereafter of e.g., Aquinas. (DeSmedt)

David Mitchell,Cloud Atlas(novel, 2004). There is a distinctive Mitchell-style – complex
worlds where everything is secretly interconnected and paranoia is completely
justified.Cloud Atlasis his best, especially in the middle
chapters when he essentially invests a new dialect to describe life in a
catastrophic time. (Sullivan)

Elizabeth Moon,The Speed of Dark(novel, 2002). The protagonist is a scientist with autism in a
near-future world in which there may be a “cure” for his condition. The
quotation marks are there because one of the central issues has to do with
whether autism is a condition that in fact needs curing. I don’t think I’d
heard of the idea of neurodiversity when I read this, but it strikes me as
exactly the idea under consideration. (Yap)

Michael Moorcock,
“Pale Roses”(short story, 1974). While we think that post-humanity will override
most of our base evolutionary motivations, this literary story raises profound
questions about the meaning of a human life through a setting in which
human-like characters are virtually immortal and have nearly limitless
powers... but still desperately want to be invited to parties. (Nichols)

Thomas More,Utopia(novel, 1516). Well, if you did not know it inventedscifi, but it allows reflections on equilibria in the sense

Star Wars On Trial, DavidBrinet al.(non-fiction anthology, 2006)Resolved: Stars Wars is crap and the
cause of the ever-increasingcrapificationof sf.That’s pretty much it. Then the various authors line up and go at it, hammer
and tongs, pro and con. This book is fun, available in a cheap Kindle edition
(as of this writing) and extremely helpful for teaching-by-example a particular
style of writing: informal, opinionated, argumentative (in all senses) personal
essays. This is also a good book for bridging the literary-vs-film gap, if you
need something to help you over that hump; and to help address the historically
huge phenomenon ofStars Wars—something
curiously invisible if you are just using, say, the Wesleyan anthology. At a
certain point sf becamemostlynot on

J. R. R. Tolkien, “Ainulindalë”(inTheSilmarillion,
published 1977). Tolkien’s Neo-Platonic creation myth puts the rest of the
stories about Middle Earth in a distinctly different cosmic context, hints of
which can be seen in the better-known works only after one has read the cosmic
“backstory”. (Horst)

Harry Turtledove, “Getting Real”(short
story, 2009).In the near future, the
USA is in the economic and cultural thrall of China because American citizens
are hopelessly addicted to foreign VR technology. A very edgy, self-consciously
allegorical piece of political SF. (Silcox)

CatherynneValente,Palimpsest(novel,
1959). A city is transmitted through physical touch and is only able to be
visited by those who have been infected. Physicalism. (Bernstein)

order to stop a societal genocide of surrogates and humans alike. (Brophy)

David Foster
Wallace,Infinite Jest(novel, 1996). Philosophy by virtue of mentioning “Montague Grammar
and the Semantics of Physical Modality”, science fiction by virtue of being set
in the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment, fun by virtue of including
basically everything in between. (Dever)

Jo Walton,The Just City(novel, 2015).  Time traveling goddess
Athena tries to set up Plato’sRepublicin the pre-Homeric Mediterranean
world.  Socrates shows up.  Hijinks and philosophical ruminations
ensue. (Mills)

Sarah Waters,The Little Stranger(novel, 2009). How well do we know ourselves? (Evnine)

WimWenders,Until
the End of the World(movie, 1991).Compared to the usual orgies of explosions,
light saber duels, and last minute races to save the galaxy, there’s something
about the laid-back, slightly spacey tone of this film that gives it
considerable novelty value. It’s also one of the earliest movies to depict a
high-tech future in which the paint still sometimes peels off the walls and
airplane engines still sometimes cut out in mid-flight. The last third of the
story, in which characters become addicted to handheld devices that depict
their previous nights’ dreams, is curiously prophetic. (Silcox)

The Wesleyan Anthology of
Science Fiction,Arthur B. Evans et al., eds.(anthology, 2010).When I was first
planning to teach SF and Philosophy I fretted long and fruitlessly about which
anthology to make into the spine of my syllabus. There are an awful lot of
choices—new and old, cheap and expensive. Many of them are very good. Still, I
had a perfectionist temptation to make my own from scratch. But it’s better to
give the kidssomeonepublished collection they can have and hold. I decided the Wesleyan was best of
the lot. My personal dissents from the editors’ selections could be turned from
bugs into teaching features as we went along. (You’re never going to be
perfectly happy with someone else’s anthology about a subject close to your
heart, when it comes to teaching that subject. It’s like using someone else’s
toothbrush. Well, deal with it.)Some of
my choices below are how-to-fix the Wesleyan tips (by my lights). One fix too
big for any top-10 list:theWesleyan is
Anglophone—i.e. mostly Americans and Brits. That is a defensible editorial
focus, and is tolerably clear from the Table of Contents, if not the cover. You
can’t be everything to everyone, plus everywhere at once. (If you want
something more international, the very newThe
Big Book of Science Fiction, edited by theVandermeers,
looks a solid option.) (Holbo)

Roger Williams,The Metamorphosis of Prime
Intellect(novel, 1994) A virtual god, subservient to Asimov’s laws of
robotics, emerges from the technological singularity, and the ensuing cosmic
paternalism puts every human into a heaven they desperately want out of,
despite (or because of) all the sex and ultraviolence. (Mandik)

StanisławIgnacyWitkiewicz,Nienasycenie[Insatiability](novel, 1927). Excellent on
mind control:anAsian army controls brains bymurtib’inga pill making pliant subjects. (Palma)

John Wyndham,The Day of theTriffids(novel,
1951). Giant deadly shrubs ambulate around a London riven by a plague of
blindness. Moody, scary, tense, dark. An early pioneer of biologicalscifi, Wyndham reminds us that plants can be evil too.
(Clarke)

Charles Yu,Howto Live Safely in a Science Fictional
Universe(novel, 2010). Only 93 percent of the laws of physics
were installed in this universe. People time travel, but mostly in sad
desperate attempts to change the past. Yu, the narrator and character in the
book, is a low level technician whose job is to stop them. Cool send-up of time
travel books, but very human story. (Callender)

PamelaZoline, “The Heat Death of the Universe”(short story, 1967). Avant-garde writing, and genre-challenging,
since it does not have most (any?) of the usual marks of science fiction.
Concerns the uselessness of scientific knowledge in the face of existential
despair and the experience of meaninglessness. (Wittkower)

·“The Measure of a Man”(TV episode, 1989)

oThe artificial intelligence, Data, is forced to go on trial to prove
that he has the right to self-determination and is not the property of
Starfleet. (Cameron)

oCan an AI be a person, in the moral sense or legal sense? In this
episode, a scientist wishes to disassemble the android (and Second Lieutenant)
Data, a procedure that might kill him. The scientist goes as far as arguing
that Data is not a person, but property (and hence, has no right to
self-determination). A trial is held to determine Data’s status. (Keeley)

oThe trial to determine whether the Android Data is a person or the
property of Star Fleet provides the context for an engaging exploration of
personhood and artificial life. (Horst)

·“Who Watches the Watchers” /
“First Contact” / “Thine Own Self”(TV episodes, 1989/1991/1994):
The prime directive (non-interference with less advanced civilizations) is one
of the most fascinating elements from Star Trek. These episodes do an excellent
job of exploring the ethics of non-interference and undisclosed observation,
and raise questions about the withholding of beneficial advances required by
it. (Powell)

·“Sarek”(TV episode, 1990). Dementia, social role, telepathy,telempathy, Stoicism, pietas, duty, honor. (Oppenheimer)

·“The Inner Light”(TV episode, 1992). An alien probe causes Captain Picard to

with identity, memory, survival, and the representation of time. (Frankish)

oAI ,the problem of
other minds... does anyone really needBlade
Runnerglossed at this point?
(Weinberg)

oBiologically engineered artificial intelligence “replicants”
are indistinguishable from humans in almost every way. But they are not seen as
“persons”. Humans fear them, and have banned them from Earth, they are only
used off-world slave labor. They also have a four-year life-span. The main
character, Deckard, is a Blade Runner, whose job is to hunt and “retire” anyreplicantsfound on Earth. A group of them have returned to
Earth, because they are nearing four years, and don’t want to die. Are they
really alive, and deserving of respect and autonomy? Or are they mere machines,
that can be “retired” with impunity? Explores the important ethical dimensions
of AI, especially critiquing the idea that humans are special as pure hubris,
motivated by an unjustified belief in the “supremacy” of the biological over
the artificial. (See alsoBattlestarGalactica(2004-9),Bicentennial Man, andStar Trek TNG’s “Measure of a
Man” episode). (Cash)

oCovers issues in philosophy of mind: consciousness and the
possibility of artificial intelligence. Also, an illustration of film as
philosophy (Mulhall, 2008).InOn
Film(2008, 2nd edition),
StephenMulhallcontends that there is a
philosophical debate about the nature of mortality between Leon (areplicant) and Deckard (a blade runner hired to “retire”
Leon), Ch. 20, Director’s Cut DVD. This is also discussed in thePhilosophy Bitesepisode, “StephenMulhallon Film as Philosophy.”) (Campbell)

oThis film is a cinematic masterpiece.Set in the near future a dystopian Los
Angeles it treats the topic of the sentience of androids with great sensitivity
and features one of the richest endings in film (if you ask me). Dick’s novel
adds major elements to the story that the film does not capture. Still, the
film is excellent in its own right. (Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?is also recommended.)(Schneider)

oBased on a Philip K. Dick novel, but with more philosophical depth
than the book. It sparks at least these two great philosophical questions:
Could androids be people? and What would you ask or say to your creator, if you
were really angry about the human condition? (Daly)

·Total Recall(movie, 1990; loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story “We

oIn a world where memories can be implanted and erased, a man
struggles to know who he is and what is real. (Cameron)

oThemes of memory and identity; illusion and reality. Who are you
really? and what is “real” anyway? Quaid dreams about Mars. He tries resolving
this by taking a virtual vacation involving installing memories of a spy-themed
adventure to Mars. Quaid emerges to realize he might be a spy who had had his
memory erased, and who has mistakenly believed he was an ordinary guy. But is
this really happening, or is the whole thing taking place in the virtual
vacation? Who is Quaid “really”; a spy/assassin who thought he was an ordinary
guy, or an ordinary guy who used to be a spy/assassin, or just an ordinary guy
dreaming he is a spy (who used to be an assassin)? What matters more, who we
“really” are, or who we choose to be? (Cash)

oBased on a Philip K. Dick story, this raises skeptical concerns

·eXistenZ(movie, 1999). The story revolves aroundanvirtual reality game in which you play a part in a story about a plot to murder
the designer of a virtual reality game (and take a guess what the topic of the
game within a game is!). This movie came out the same year asThe Matrixand if you ever wondered what might
have happened if they had explored the possibility of a Matrix running inside
the Matrix, this is your movie. This film pairs well with Descartes’Meditationsby asking how would you know that
you were in “reality” as opposed to a well-designed immersive video game? It
also explores a number ofSartreanthemes (hence, the
title) concerning the nature of free will and the roles we adopt in life.

SpikeJonze

·Being John Malkovich(movie, 1999; written by Charlie Kaufman, who also wroteEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind;see
above). A fanciful exploration of issues in personal identity. John Cusack’s
character discovers a portal that lets you experience the world from the
perspective of actor John Malkovich. It’s fun to get students to explore what’s
incoherent in how this process works, according to the film. Also, you can pair
this movie with Daniel Shaw’s “On Being Philosophical andBeing John Malkovich, which
explores the questions of whether and how a film can be “philosophical” or “do
philosophy”. Be warned that this film depicts violence towards women and
animals. Further, one of the main characters (albeit not a sympathetic one)

It’s the first special effects blockbuster, which failed (it lost money). It’s
the first glossy triumph of sexy style over philosophical substance (that is
trying to be philosophical, despite succumbing to its own sexy siren song of
style.) It’s the first blockbuster dystopia. It’s dumb (which might trick you
into thinking you can skip it, but you would be an idiot to do that, at least
if you seek any kind of history angle on the subject.) Less well-known: you
have to Teach Menzies’ (H.G. Wells scripted)ThingsToCome, which was a deliberate,
blockbuster response to Lang’s failed blockbuster—which also failed and lost
money.Thingsis highly utopian and
rationalistic in spirit, which plays very weird onscreen. It’s a study in hownotto makeStar Wars(for example). The students will dislike it. Then you ask
them: list everything this film does wrong, by contemporary Hollywood
standards. Might it be that Wells was trying to write a philosophy of
technology? (Alas, an sf screenplay cannot be a philosophy of technology.) This
is an excellentvianegativaexercise. (Holbo)

The Leftovers(TV series, 2014-present). (I confess I haven’t read the book of
that title by TomPerrotta, who is also one of the
makers of the show.) The premise is that all of a sudden, at a point about
three years before the story starts, about 2% of the world’s population just…
vanished. Poof. It’s kind of like the rapture, except it’s clear that the
departed people weren’t any better than everyone else, and indeed, there doesn’t
seem to be any pattern to who did or did not vanish. It’s maybe a borderline
case of the SF/Fantasy genre. What I find compellingly philosophical about it,
inter alia, is that it is an exploration of what it would be like to like in a
world in which you had evidence thatHumeanworries
about induction really were true. What if the universe did just throw us a
massive, inexplicable,unprojectablecurve ball? How
would we conduct our lives? (For a much, much darker, weirder, and horrifying
exploration of the unknowable in sci-fi form, I can recommend JeffVandermeer’s“Southern Reach” trilogy:Annihilation,Authority, andAcceptance. But I’m not sure I
even know how to begin glossing it, frankly. So I’m cheating and helping myself
to a parenthetical here.) (Weinberg)

JocelynMoorhouse,Proof(movie, 1991). A very early film of both Russell Crowe and Hugo
Weaving (so, fun for that reason alone), in which Weaving plays a curmudgeonly
blind person with real trust issues. Part of his worry about being deceived
revolves around his lack of access to the visual world, so he has taken to
taking photographs, having sighted people tell him what’s in the images,
writing that (in braille) on the back, and then checking those descriptions
against what other sighted people report. An interesting exploration of
epistemology as well as what epistemic standards are appropriate to what
situations. (Keeley)

Terry Nation et
al.,Survivors(TV series, 1975-7). A plague wipes out most of humanity and the few
survivors try to rebuild society. The series explores political and
philosophical issues, including the relation between the individual and the
collective, the trade-off between freedom and security, and gender politics.
Highlights include the episodes “Law and Order”, “Lights of London”, and “Over
the Hills”. (Frankish)

Red Dwarf, “Justice”(TV show, 1991). The Justice
Field makes it physically impossible for injustice to be committed! (Yap)

AlainResnais,Je t’aime,Je t’aime(movie,
1968). A man time travels through the last year of a tragic relationship,
re-experiencing events in random order. Uses time travel as a metaphor for
memory and the way we construct our identities through narrative. (Frankish)

JacSchaeffer,Timer(movie, 2009). Almost every person is outfitted with a device that
counts down to the minute the wearer will meet his or her soulmate. (Not as
cheesy as it sounds.) Some choose not to have timers, where others rebel and
have relationships with people known to contradict their timers. Fatalism, free
will, utilitarianism. (Bernstein)

Tom Scott, “Welcome
to Life: The Singularity, Ruined by Lawyers”(YouTube video, 2012). Everyone can have digital immortality, but
not everyone can afford a version unsullied by direct brain advertising. (Mandik)

Stephen Spielberg,Minority Report(movie,
2002). Covers the topic of pre-punishment: Can we punish people, or hold them
morally responsible, for acts that they (arguably) will commit yet have not yet
committed? (Based on the Philip K. Dick short story of the same name, 1956. See
SaulSmilansky, “Determinism andPrepunishment:theRadical Nature of Compatibilism”, 2007.)
(Campbell)

Star Trekoriginal series, “The Mark of Gideon,”(TV episode, 1969). Wonderful example of the way manipulating frames
of epistemological reference can drive humanbehaviour.
(Bakker)

Alex Temple,Switch:
A Science Fiction Micro-Opera(work of music, 2013, recorded in performance by the Cadillac Moon
Ensemble). In a society that draws deep class distinctions between the
left-handed and the right-handed, a group of “hand offenders” rebels against
the social categories on offer. (Briggs)

fundamental right? (Bernstein)

RobertZemeckis,Back

here, and they at least got close. (Chalmers)
